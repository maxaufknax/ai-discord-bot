eddie: Advice for ad metrics of new product tests (only for the first 1 to 7 days) Write your metrics below using all the information listed in the new product tests template from #üìëÔ∏±templates , and I'll get back to you as soon as I find time:

Honestly my question is, what would you do with this? maybe test a different angle with new ads again? Overrall i'm at a 1.55 ROAS, since i started on the 13th till today, with $3,600 rev and $2,300 spend. I already tested new ads twice (4 yesterday and had $3 cpc and 3 today at $3.5 cpc) - not sure if i should give it another go at the ads for tomorrow or what? Something to note is that I have 1 ad set with 11 sales at over 4.8 ROAS with $170 (around 9 days) spend and another interest with 9 sales and a 5.7 ROAS and just $110 spend

eddie: Hey, first post! Let's see. You wrote the wrong ad spend vs. revenue per country in today's data, or wrong total ad spend vs. revenue. Either way, it looks like it's declining. It could be because of BFCM, some brands spend millions of dollars per day these days. You can see, even your CPC went up like 1.8x. I think this is most likely a mid winner, and if you added retargeting ads + some upsells, and - most importantly - improved your website (social proof, videos, images, better copywriting), it would eventually work. I'd ride it out these days, you're still slightly profitable, so it's not bad. Keep the momentum running to keep competitors out of the market who want to try your product, while improving all the things I mentioned above. There's a decent chance this product turns around in January. If not, next. Meanwhile, besides improving what I listed above, also look for new products to test after BFCM.

eddie: What's up, Hocus Cockus. Risky testing shit right now but let's see. It's not looking too bad actually. Weirdly enough, UK got the sales, wow. I wouldn't remove the other countries yet. Let's kill every ad set without sales, and duplicate the ones with sales up to 4 new ad sets. Change interests to new ones.

Retard girl hates daddy: Hey @eddie , I have some ad sets I want to turn off as they are not profitable last 3 days, but overall profitable.

But now there is only 1 sale from all ABOs today. Yesterday I got 4 sale from ABO $240 revenue with 1.4 ROAS. Some of the ad sets I kept a bit more than $10 to see how they worked (as they had higher IC amounts), it also decreased ROAS. What do you advise me about ABO? After running CBO they are not getting profit. Note that today I added 6 new ad sets as you advised me yesterday. But recently, none of the ABO works well, I mean profitable after 2-3 days. Thanks (edited)

eddie: Hey, Your wrote the wrong ad set daily budget, probably. Also, very little ad spend today. Hard to judge. Kill all ad sets that are unprofitable in the last 4 days and didn't get a sale today. Add 3 more ad sets for tomorrow with new interests.

eddie: Hey, Not bad, not bad. AU doing really good. Dude, why create CBOs on day 2? Haven't you learned anything yet? Anyway, today's a bit crappy for smaller stores. Don't let it faze you. Kill all ad sets that are unprofitable in the last 3 days and didn't get a sale today. Make 3 new T4 ad sets (new interests), and 2 new AU only ad sets (one broad, one with interest).

Ad account is in Pacific time so it's 3 hours behind NYC. Not sure if it's worth it to keep targeting T4. Let me know what you think, Thanks!

eddie: Hey, 7 days AU spend vs. revenue makes no sense. Bad day today. Just stay composed. At the end of the day, kill all ad sets that have been unprofitable in the last few days IF they didn't get a sale today. No CBOs yet. If AU is profitable in the last 4 days (you wrote that it is), then make 3 new T4 ad sets with new interests, and 2 USA ones, scheduled to start at midnight. If AU isn't profitable overall in the last 4 days, just make 5 new USA ad sets with new interests, scheduled to start at midnight.

eddie: Hey, Na, kill this shit. You're gonna struggle with that price. You're getting okay CPMs & CPCs, but it's just not bringing enough revenue. I'm sure there's room to improve the website (and, therefore, conversion rate) but it's going to be a struggle for you to make this sell 4 times better to get a good ROAS. Id' move on and focus on products at around $35-40 minimum. If you want to get advice on how to improve your website, share it during Sunday roast. (edited)

(edited)

eddie: Hey, niiiice! It picked up. Hmmm... No USA sales, very little ad spend, we need more. Okay, so make 4 more Top 4 ad sets, new interests, and 2 new USA-only ad sets (1 new interest, 1 current best interest). Kill only ad sets that had no sales today and last day combined.

eddie: Hey, Very low profit still but CPMs should drop after a few days, I'd presume. For now, my suggestion is make 3-4 new ad sets, new interests, Top4. I wouldn't make CBOs yet because you're barely profitable, your ads aren't scalable. And I'd kill all ad sets that are not profitable in the last 3 days if they got no sale today. I don't think your ads will magically become scalable after BFCM though, you still have to make better ads. I'd look for a new product too, this feels mid. (edited)

Alright, let's schedule 1 CBO for tomorrow, just 1 'cause it might be a shit day. 4-5 new ad sets targeting AU + USA, new interests.

eddie: Hey, Okay, so... You said your BE ROAS is 1.8 in the 7-day data. I assume that's just your ROAS. Secondly, you asked if you should bump the budget with 2 hours into the day. Read the PDF / #üí°Ô∏±quick-tips / #üí¨Ô∏±hustler-chat and the post in #üßóÔ∏±scaling and don't ask stupid questions again. ---- The store's picking up very well. Schedule 5-6 more ad sets with new interests into your ABO for midnight. Launch another CBO for tomorrow with an eligible ad set. Scheduled at midnight. Kill (20 min. before midnight) ad sets that are unprofitable in the last 4 days (inc. today) if they haven't gotten a sale today. Post in #üßóÔ∏±scaling from now on.

eddie: Hey, Not bad, we went up! Okay, no new creatives just yet. We're fine there. Kill (20 min. before midnight) ad sets that are unprofitable in the these 4 days (inc. today) if they haven't gotten a sale today. Make 5-7 new ad sets. 3-4 for top 4 with new interests. 3 for USA only, 2 new interests, 1 currently proven (if you got one). I wouldn't schedule a CBO just yet, profitability is quite low. Start abandoned checkouts & upsells, yes.

eddie: Hey, It's not awful, the CPC is high but it could be temporary (BFCM just running out). I say we run this another day at least. Schedule 4-5 new ad sets for midnight, 2 for top4, 3 USA-only.

Kill all ad sets without a sale within those 2 days of testing. No, don't scale anything yet, and don't scale just the working countries.

eddie: Hey, Crazy how you're profitable with that CPC. I don't understand why you're just spending $50/day. If you're running on a DSL BM, then read the rules of these channels. For now, add 5-6 more interests, $20/day, scheduled for midnight. Kill ad sets without checkouts today, or without sales within these 2 days.

eddie: Hey, man. Told you it was just a shit day yesterday. Always stay composed. Make 2 new top 4 interests, 4 more USA-only ones for midnight. $20/day. Kill ad sets that have been unprofitable in the last 4 days if they also got no sales today (including new ad sets). No CBOs yet.

eddie: Hey, BE ROAS is too high, man. Your ads are doing a good job so far though. Duplicate those two ad sets that got sales 2.5 times (= 5 ad sets), change the interests. Do them all as USA-only. Kill ad sets with no checkouts.

I think since I updated my website the performance should be a lot better. I added more pictures as well. **I changed the product price from $30 to $39.99. I changed the price after I got the first sale. @eddie my metrics for the ads were amazing though. I think it was website tbh.

eddie: Hey, tits. $30 price range is quite low for Facebook ads. These ads should've been stopped long before. Also, you shouldn't change the price mid test. This product is a bust, man. Next it. I say show this in Sunday roast if you want deeper advice.

eddie: Hey, man. It doesn't look like this is picking up. This is most likely a combination of a mid product (or a product that's already being sold by too many people in relation to the size of its market) and a bad website . Can't say exactly, obviously, 'cause I have no access to your funnel. In my opinion, you should just find a new product because this one's too much struggle and not worth the time investment.

eddie: Hey, This is a tough one... I'd give it one more day, but you must understand that's a risk and could end up in just burning money.

I've ran this product before joining the DC and it was profitable (1.8 - 2 ROAS for a week) in the testing campaign, but I CBOd it 7 times and it kept flopping (was only using 1 creative), I wanted to try it again with your strategy. Also, how important is a better website if the copy writing stays the same but with more social proof, looks way better, etc.? My website is ok I'd say (gets between 2 to 4% CVR), but not as good as the one in the training, so I made one more like it. Should I upload it at midnight or middle of the day is fine? What can I do to make it work this time and what should I do for tomorrow? Also, there's not much content for it, it's going to be hard to make other creatives atm UTMs didn't track a lot of the ICs, should I still turn off interests? (edited)

eddie: Hey, hot hymen. The issue here are the creatives, you won't get far with a $2 CPC with a product that's likely just a mid winner. Your website's probably good enough but if you want to give this a good shot, you need significantly better creatives, very different to what you're running now.

eddie: Hey, It lost some momentum, it seems. The ABO is not doing great. You definitely need new ad creatives to try to refresh this. Did you make new creatives for the Retargeting campaign, like I suggested? Other than that, I say still make 4-5 new ad sets in the ABO, try 2 lookalikes (95% VV and either FB or IG engagement - based on where most of your sales are coming from). Kill ad sets that got no sales today if they also got no sales yesterday. Also kill new ad sets that got no sales today. Kill CBO#2, #3, #4 if they do shit by the end of the day.

eddie: Hey, It's picking up, huh? Nice! Let's add $200 to CBO#1. And let's make 4-5 new ad sets in the ABO. If the lookalikes you tried earlier, as I advised, worked well, try some page views (last 30-60 days) as well, 3%. Kill ad sets that got no sales today if they're also unprofitable in the last 4 days. Also kill new ad sets that got no sales today. Kill any CBO that was shit for 3 days in a row, or only ran for 2 days but they were both shit.

eddie: Hey, You'll struggle at scale with this BE ROAS. I'd apply the same strats. 4-5 new ad sets for tomorrow targeting the combination of countries that's doing well, new interests.

But I guess after analizing your previous suggestions to hustlers this is just a kill and if I'm not mistaken the ads are the big problem in my case right? The ads didn't start spending at the first few hours and now in the end again stopped spending for the last few hours, so just wanted to get your opinion on this, maybe the 4 ATC shows that the website is trash as well? Just a kill and go back to the drawing board right, Eddie?

eddie: Hello, CPC is massive, so yes, most likely it is your ads that suck. You got some buying intent though, so maybe with better ads you could make it work. It's hard to make significantly better ads without buying your own content and editing it - so it's up to you if you want to take that risk. I think this is a bust otherwise.

Your ads are probably shit, that's why your CPC is high, but I wouldn't have turned off a profitable campaign, man. Why?

eddie: Hey, Crustiest thong. This is dead. No, interests are never the problem. Good CPMs doesn't mean your ad is convincing either. In your case, since there are 0 ATCs, most likely the product is shit, otherwise you'd get at least some buying intent, even on a shit website.

eddie: Hmmm... So close to being profitable. Your CPC is a bit high, and a lot of people drop at checkout. I feel like probably your ads aren't convincing enough, paired with a website made while you were jerking off to cavity removal videos. If those were just a bit better, you'd probably be profitable. A winning product doesn't need loads of effort though, so while I'd improve on what I mentioned above, I wouldn't give this more than another day or two of testing if it stays unprofitable. Make 2-3 new interests duplicated from current profitable ad sets. Kill all new ad sets without sales, and old ad sets that were unprofitable within those 3 days if they also got no sales today.

eddie: Hey, Super low price. Massive CPC to sustain even a $35 price point but there are sales. Hmm... Is this product overdone, competitive? I have a feeling your ads are showing to a lot of people who already bought this product from somewhere else? Since there are sales and the CPC is unreasonable, considering I know you can make good ads, I'd cruise with it for 2-3 days, testing 2-3 new interests each day and only killing ad sets with 0 buying intent. It's very risky, but I think your ads have simply not yet found new buyers and that's why your metrics are high. That's my opinion, you do what you think.

I would like to inform you that this is most likely an untapped product I found on TT. Amazon has 3-4 listings with about 500+ items bought last month (according to Amazon). I only found one competitor in the ad library. Also the product is in the Healthcare niche and solves a big problem, and what's better is that according to the Amazon reviews it actually works and helps customers.

eddie: Hey, What in the world is this CPC? The ads aren't hitting the spot, man. You got some buying intent but if you really want to make a health product work, you'll likely need your own content for ads.

Was going to let it run 24 hours but wasn't sure if it was worth waiting at this rate. It's health related so using mid-form infomercial & friendly style content with what I consider really solid hooks. I run the website and copywriting for my company that I do CGI advertising for so I consider myself having a good eye for design/editing/copy etc and I'm struggling to see what I've done wrong/missing here other than the price being too high? Competitor that I found has scaled up to 350 ads for the last 3 months up to now, and their site is a terribly designed advertorial and they're pricing it for the same $59.99, which I'm really surprised they're doing (and supposedly getting away with if they're scaling ads to that level?) If i hadn't seen the price they set I would've guessed to sell at around $29.99 for the product i'm selling. This is the only thing I could think is putting people off? I may very well be overestimating my skills in things though. Thanks

eddie: Hey, Good buying intent. I say don't kill ad sets because of the CPC for now. Test 3-4 more ad sets with new interests for midnight. Kill what got no checkouts.

eddie: Hey, man. Sorry, this is a bust. Most likely the ads sucked or product was super saturated. Decent CPM but high CPC & 0 buying intent. Show the ads/store in Sunday roast, there's not more I could say from what we got here.

Health/Sleep related. It's a very close variation of a full company selling the exact same product for $100 on amazon. One competitor on ad library with terrible site and image ads. I did actually find the original company on fb ads eventually, but with no videos and very basic albeit on-brand imagery, so thought there was a potential angle. Created 7 variations, mix of UGC ads & mid-form infomercial. I've definitely improved my ads 10x from the previous test, watched a bunch of content on it and implemented better voiceovers, storytelling/copywriting, editing in general etc. Website is also improved with inspiration from some of the big players out there alongside much better reviews this time with accompanying imagery. Hit the $50 spend in about half the time of my first test, and with no buying intent it seems like it's another dead one. Let me know what you think. Another one for sunday roast? Cheers boss

eddie: Hey, High CPM & CPC does indicate that your ads aren't good, man, or they're simply not structured well to resonate with this specific target market. Low buying intent also. Maybe it's a shit product for FB. You said there's one competitor but said nothing about them - maybe they're also making no money, And it sounds like the main company is only running retargeting ads on FB.

eddie: Hey, man. Could be a few reasons... 1. Product sucks (I doubt it's this one because you did get buying intent and somewhat close to profitable). 2. Your ads suck (can't see them = can't tell). 3. The product is old or rinsed (in which case, unless your ads are wildly different to your competitors', Facebook will send you the same traffic that lost its virginity to them). ---- Use this information, combined with what you know about your entire funnel, to figure out what's wrong and what can be done.

Personally, I'm into young boys: Hey @eddie lmk what you think, thank you! This was the product you didn‚Äôt have high hopes for but i wanted to test it for my own peace of mind. Competitor decreased ads from 52 to 5 ads since yesterday. His ads and website were not that good though. I also tested the product a bit cheaper than he did because I didn‚Äôt feel the perceived value was that high for this product. I had to turn off 7 adsets just now that had around $6 CPC to no CPC (no one clicked on the adsdet). It was doing pretty good actually around 5 hours in, it had $1.40 CPC and $18 CPM with 5 ATC and 2 IC and 0 PUR, but i went to sleep and it didn‚Äôt do much since then. Not sure if I can improve much in the funnel, cuz I believe I did a really good job, but maybe this product isnt it. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Base information: ‚Ä¢ product selling price (charging shipping?) & break even ROAS: $50 (yes charging shipping) & BE ROAS 1.42 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product: 15 hours ‚Ä¢ daily budget per ad set: 9 x 20 US | 9 x 10 Top 5 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting: US, UK, CA, NZ, AU ‚Ä¢ are you running retargeting ads?

eddie: Hey, It was clear from the beginning that this was a losing product because your competitors are clearly dying in front of you. Bad choice to test it. Ads are also not working out (high CPC - low CPM = people don't care about the product). No buying intent - just window shoppers or dropshippers spying on your store. Clear skip, waste of money.

eddie: Hey, Ohhh, not bad! Maybe we got something here! The CPMs and CPCs aren't ideal but let's cruise a bit and see what it looks like once we get more data.

I want to try and push this test a bit further but keep in mind that we'll definitely need better ads if it works out.

eddie: Arghhh, this is super annoying. Great CPC but it's not converting too well. The low AOV isn't helping us either. It's either the product or the site. Unless you can improve the site tremendously, just kill it and next.

Depends, sometimes it takes 5 minutes, sometimes it takes 12 hours. FB's mysteries. Doesn't matter in your case anyway, you see your buying intent on Shopify. 3.

eddie: Hey, Not the best first day but I'd give it another shot. Let's kill all ad sets that got no sales or less than 2 checkouts. And schedule 3 more (duplicated from the current winning ad sets) with new interests for the next day.

What is a "Pee Dee Eff"?: Hey @eddie , I tried to do long form ads with a product that is scaling with short form + mid form. I thought the script and the page were very good, scientific and easy to understand at the same time.

eddie: Nice work! Schedule 5 new interests @ $20/day for midnight. 3 for USA, 2 for TOP5. Schedule 1 CBO @ $200/cay for the best interest you have that's eligible (PDF). Kill new ad sets that got 0 checkouts after spending $20. Kill ad sets that got no sales for 3 days in a row (including today). You can post in #üßóÔ∏±scaling next. (edited)

eddie: It's discouraging to see USA not work but clearly there's some traction, and it's early. I'd stick with this one a bit longer. I'd kill all ad sets with no checkouts EOD. + schedule 3-4 more interests duplicated from current winners. Let me know how it does tomorrow.

PS: I turned off unprofitable ad sets on day 3 of 6 and duplicated the ad set interests which were getting most sales, but got no sales from the new duplicated ad sets. On day 6 of 6, I duplicated most profitable ad set interest and ran it with completely new creatives, but no change in sales. (edited)

eddie: Hey, It's possible that the website is the issue but 0 checkouts? Even with a bad website, if the product was good, we'd get a lot more action. Unless you got 23 trust badges, a white ATC button on a green background, I'll assume the product is at fault - maybe even the ads

eddie: Hey, No buying intent, somewhat high CPC, I guess the ads suck cock, but it could also be the product - maybe old? Trying a different angle is good, but always have 1-2 ads using the same angle as your competitors too, just to be sure you're giving yourself the best chance.

Hi Eddie, I had a lot of confidence in this product. The product is not old, and I don't understand why the CPC + CPM are so high. I made middle-form ads (20-40 sec) and I don't think my ads are that bad, to be honest. I thought that since the product is quite expensive and I haven't spent much yet, I could leave it a bit longer. What do you think? @eddie

eddie: Damn, dude. CPC's massive. It doesn't matter if you think your ads are bad or not, they clearly are. Are you sure middle form is for this product? Try short-form too (based on what it is). And make it fast, snappy, get to the point (benefit) quick - if you really want to give it another shot. Don't leave it running like this. You'll just burn money. (edited)

eddie: Niiice! Smaller day, that's cool. We push with confidence for tomorrow anyway. Schedule for midnight 2 new TOP5 interests & 3 new USA ones at $20/day IF some of the last top5 ad sets we made yesterday brought sales. Otherwise just make only 5 USA new ones instead. Kill new ad sets that got no checkouts today. Kill old ad sets that got no sales in the last 4 days. Schedule 2 CBOs at $100/day with eligible ad sets you've had since day 1, which also got a sale today. No need for retargeting yet.

eddie: Hey, Shit, why's the CPC so far, damn. Well, we need to let this play out longer. It probably won't still be profitable at end of the day, or it'll be breaking even. I suggest - EOD - killing all ad sets that got no sales and scheduling 3-4 more tomorrow, duplicated from current ad sets with sales. Need at least 1 more day.

eddie: Yes, babyyy! (by the way, next time reply to my reply) So T5's is showing some promise, from what I can tell. I think we should try 2 more T5 interests for tomorrow, 4 more USA interests also. Schedule a CBO @ $100/day with an eligible ad set that you created on day 1, which got sales every day including today. Kill new ad sets that got no checkouts. Kill old ad sets that got no sales at all in these 3 days, or if you made them yesterday - kill them if they had no sales yesterday & today.

eddie: Hey, man. Weird, I guess it just glitched, nothing unusual. Facebook being Facebook. Either way, stats look good. USA doesn't look that good but I don't want to give up on it. You need to update the metrics towards the end of the day because we don't want to make new ad sets now, the day just started.

eddie: Hey, Makes sense. I feel like we had a lucky first day but... I also wouldn't give up on it just in case. So listen, it's risky but if you want to give it a shot... I'd add 2 more USA & 1 more T4 (No UK) interests duplicated from current winners for midnight. And I'd kill all ad sets that never got a sale.

eddie: Hey, Ohh, our push did good. Why call it a bad day? Let's not charge shipping for another day. I'd push more now. 2 more USA interests, 3 more top4, and another CBO at $100/day for an eligible ad set. I'd not kill any CBO yet. I know you must be thinking I'm crazy but we either push this product (and our competitors ) out of the market, or we chill at $1K days like brokemans. We need to see where the resistance is. Kill new ad sets that got less than a checkout per $10 and no sales. Kill old ad sets that got no sales in the last 4 days.
