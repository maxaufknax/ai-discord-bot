HANDLING NEGATIVE COMMENTS - EDDIE'S DAMAGE CONTROL

RULE #1: NEVER DELETE COMMENTS
- Deleting makes Facebook think viewers don't enjoy content
- Facebook may penalize your reach
- Solution: HIDE comments instead

FACEBOOK AD COMMENT HIDING:
1. Edit ad in ads manager
2. Click "Share" → "Facebook Post with Comments"
3. Hide damaging comments (don't delete)

INSTAGRAM AD COMMENT HIDING:
1. Go to business Instagram account
2. Tap menu → Settings → Privacy → Hidden Words
3. Manage Custom Words and Phrases
4. Add words to auto-hide

HIDDEN WORDS LIST (COPY-PASTE):

SPECIAL STRATEGY:
If someone insults the model (not product), reply with sad face emoji. This encourages others to defend you = more engagement = Facebook rewards with higher reach.

EDDIE'S NOTES:
- Include competitor names in hidden words
- Add product-specific negative terms
- Use alternative spellings and typos
- Facebook loves engagement, use it strategically
