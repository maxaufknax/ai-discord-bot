SCALING TO $30K-$50K PER DAY - EDDIE'S BLUEPRINT

PREREQUISITES:
- Product already selling profitably
- Complete marketing funnel (retargeting, optimized offer, email/SMS sequences)
- Bundles/upsells/post-purchase upsells

1. SETTING UP THE BASE:
- Start scaling within first 2-4 days of profitable ads
- Continuously spread horizontally in ABO test campaign daily
- Duplicate profitable ad sets with similar audiences at midnight
- Give yourself best chance of finding new profitable ad sets

2. PICK THE RIGHT AUDIENCES:
CRITERIA FOR SCALING:
- Consistently above 2.5 ROAS / 30% profit margin
- 3-6 day performance window
- Total spend of $60-120 USD
- Break even ROAS assumption: 1.5

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:
✅ Ad Set 3: $60 spent, $155 made (2.58 ROAS) - SCALABLE
✅ Ad Set 5: $120 spent, $370 made (3.0 ROAS) - SCALABLE  
✅ Ad Set 7: $80 spent, $250 made (3.5 ROAS) - SCALABLE
❌ Ad Set 1: $60 spent, $80 made (1.3 ROAS) - NOT READY

EDDIE'S CALCULATED RISK STRATEGY:
Only scale 2 out of 3 qualified ad sets. If tomorrow is bad day, scaling all 3 could result in losses. Take calculated risks only.

3. SMOOTH SCALING:
- Put each winning audience in own single-ad-set CBO
- Start at $100/day (or $200/day if ROAS was above 5-6)
- Schedule to start at midnight
- Keep original ABOs running if profitable

4. MORE GASOLINE (Budget Increases):
DAY 2 DECISIONS:
- Don't touch CBOs if profitable on first day
- If CBO has above 2.5 ROAS at 6-7 AM (ad account time), raise budget by $100
- Monitor for 3-4 hours, if still profitable, raise another $100
- Continue every ~4 hours until you feel resistance
- Sweet spot: 1-4 budget increases per day

EDDIE'S GOLDEN RULES:
- NEVER increase budgets at midnight
- Only increase when algorithm sends good quality traffic
- Watch for spending pace resistance
- If CBO spends $100-120 extremely unprofitably at any point, turn it off

ADVANCED AUDIENCE TESTING:
- After 2-3K events, test lookalike audiences (95% video views, FB/IG engagement)
- Test broad demographic targeting (no interests) after $2-3K spend
- Continue finding new winners daily
