SHOPIFY UTM ANALYSIS:

2. Column filters: Remove everything except "sessions converted"
3. Filter by:
   - Campaign content (ad UTMs)
   - Campaign medium (ad set UTMs) 
   - Campaign name (campaign UTMs)

TIMING FOR DECISIONS:
SCALING: Use UTM campaign name metrics throughout day to find best performing CBOs for budget increases

SCHEDULING: 4-7 hours before midnight, use UTM campaign medium metrics to see which interests performed well for scheduling new related interests

CUTTING: 20-30 minutes before midnight, use both metrics to eliminate bad performers

EDDIE'S REALITY CHECK:
UTMs aren't perfect either. Use them as another indicator alongside Facebook metrics. After experience, you develop 6th sense for judging what's actually profitable vs what Facebook/UTMs show.

Example: If you're very profitable that day and UTMs show CBO breaking even after $300 spend, I'd lean toward saying the CBO is actually profitable and scalable.
