eddie: Hey, first post in the scaling channel! Let's see what's up. By the looks of it, your product might be a tiny bit overpriced. I suggest charging $29 + shipping , for a start, and offering free shipping when people buy 2 pieces . Also, the product looks a lot like a mid winner. You're spending barely $1K/day and it's hovering at 1.5 ROAS, there's not enough room to scale this to $10K-20K/days right now. Your metrics might get better after BFCM, so I wouldn't give up on this. CBO#1 & #3 aren't super reliable but still good for feeding more retargeting data. If retargeting is doing well, bump up the budget on that campaign slowly, $20-30 at a time, during the day. CBO#2 is running at 20%+ profit margin, you could bump that to $200/day and up from there if it holds. New ads in ASC are likely to lift this up, so focus on that (testing new ads). (edited)

eddie: Hey, Pork chops and titty flops! The BE ROAS is a little high , that's the first thing you should work on, in my opinion. Negotiate COGS & test charging shipping ($3-5). Get to ¬± 1.3 BE ROAS somehow. There is a little room to scale but not loads. If CBO#1 gets 3-4 sales at 2+ ROAS more than 9-10 hours before midnight today, add another $200. Same for CBO#2. Why have you only been having 3 CBOs for 7 days? You need to keep testing more audiences in your ABO campaign and then scaling them in CBOs. You're not spending enough. ---- Next time posting here, please fill in the scaling template from #üìëÔ∏±templates (which was updated a few hours ago).

eddie: Hey, hey! Well done, suffering from a $35 CPM during BFCM, your ads are still killing it, $0.99 CPC, 2.4 ROAS. There's room for a lot more for you, especially after BFCM. Around Christmas most likely, depending on the product. CBO#1 - bump by $200 for now (I would've said add more but today's a bad day for you, it seems). Keep me posted because there's good room for you to scale. Make sure to also... 1. Send a Thanksgiving e-mail today with deals. 2. Continue sending e-mails with extra discounts throughout BFCM 3. Add post-purchase upsells (Reconvert - #üîßÔ∏±quick-links )

eddie: Hey, hey. Not that much room for scaling today, unfortunately. I say just let it cruise. At the end of the day only , turn off any ad sets that have been unprofitable in the last 5 days (and got no sale today). And only turn off a CBO if it's been unprofitable in the last 3 days, including today. If it's budget is over $500, drop the budget by $100-200 instead of turning it off.

eddie: Hey, hey. Hmm.. very little spend and just 2 ROAS. You can add $100-200 to CBO#2 but I don't have much faith in it (it was bad yesterday). Reduce the budget of CBO#1 at the end of the day if it doesn't turn profitable. (edited)

eddie: Hey, It's too late to scale now. You need to post at least 12-15 hours before ad account midnight (NY time ideally). Negotiate COGS because your break even ROAS is too high. Start retargeting ads. You don't need video views, you can retarget people who engaged with your post. Schedule 5-7 new ad sets for tomorrow, targeting new interests, but also lookalikes (Facebook engagers, Instagram engagers). Kill CBO#2 if it does bad on Monday. Kill all ad sets that are unprofitable with the last 4 days including today, if they also got no sales today. Leave them on only if they're at over 2.1 ROAS in the last 7 days, including today.

You made a move, now you wait for it to give you data. 4-5 new ad sets , new interests, schedule at midnight. Kill CBO#2 & CBO#3 at midnight.

eddie: Hey, Yeah, sucks but maybe it's just a couple of bad days. The CBO is profitable today. Testing new ads tomorrow is a good move. I'd get rid of all ad sets that aren't profitable within 3 days & got no sale today. And then focus on the new ad test.

eddie: Yeah, not bad overall. If the ad set you made the CBO from is still doing well, then let the CBO survive another day and see how it goes. Kill ad sets that are unprofitable in the last 4 days if they also got no sale today. Make 3-4 new ad sets. You didn't do the country breakdowns. Can't guide you there.

eddie: Can't scale anything at this time in the day, man. #üí°Ô∏±quick-tips Schedule 4-5 more ad sets with new interests for midnight. Schedule 1 more CBO if you got an eligible ad set in the ABO. Add abandoned checkout e-mails if you don't have them. Add upsells . Kill ad sets that are unprofitable in the last 4 days if they also got no sales today.

Retard girl hates daddy: Hey @eddie ! I am posting this to ask you how much should I decrease the budget as I have a problem with Shopify payment and PayPal. I deactivated PayPal now. More than 1/3 of today's sale was from PayPal. I didn't want to remove it, but I must do this. I am currently having a cash flow problem. I think not to open ABO for today until releasing PayPal holds.

eddie: Erection, what's good? Your CPC is super low for USA, I wonder why. Maybe you made super clickbaity ads? Those don't necessarily convert well. Your current setup is not super scalable now, unfortunately. It could turn around in a few days and catch some momentum again, it happens sometimes but, for now, if you want to influence it... obviously, get more content to run the strategy in the creative testing PDF start retargeting based on the retargeting PDF ---- And then, of course, keep testing 4-5 new audiences per day, start with lookalikes too.

eddie: Awesome! You need more CBOs. Schedule 7-8 new audiences in the ABO for midnight. Schedule 2-3 CBOs for tomorrow at $200/day, using eligible ad sets from the ABO.

eddie: Hey, You need to work on your BE ROAS, and - although I can't see your website - I see you get decent traffic but you don't convert it too well, so most likely you need to work on your website too. I'd focus on that. Other than that, test 2-3 new audiences per day. Kill all new ad sets that got no sales today.

eddie: Ranch, you're running lookalikes as retargeting, you absolute dumbass? What do you mean "3%"? Read the retargeting PDF before I whip out the belt. Test 4-5 new audiences, including lookalikes (properly this time). Let's give ASC a shot with a mix of your best 4-5 creatives, at $200/day. And add another CBO with an eligible new ad set.

eddie: Hello, I see you literally followed all the shit I suggested in #üß™Ô∏±testing . Beautiful. Okay, let's get $20K tomorrow. Will you trust me with like $6-7K tomorrow? Right now you MUST go add 1-2 upsells & install Reconvert from #üîßÔ∏±quick-links . Necessary. Non-negotiable. 7 more ad sets in the ABO, new interests, for midnight. Make them out of duplicates of good ad sets (so you should have a mix of USA only ones and top 5 ones). 2 more CBOs at $500/day with different interests (not the ones you already have CBOs running for) that are eligible. And tomorrow you need to talk to me throughout the day but here's the plan... Once a $200/day CBO gets 3-4 sales at good ROAS, increase it to $500. If it gets 2-3 more sales in the next 1-2 hours, jump to $1K. If it gets 3-4 more sales, jump to $2K. Once a $500/day CBO gets 5+ sales, jump it to $1K. Then $1.5K in 2 hours or so if it keeps going at the same pace. Then $2K. Push until you find resistance.

I set up new store already, and I want to test new store on the same ad account tomorrow. Can you advise me what should I do for new store's ads? I will try to use winning interests that I am using them in CBO right now, do you recommend me to test different interests also? How many new interest is good to test for new store? Also will these 2 store compete against each other in that situation? I am also not sure whether Stripe support the new store or not, but this time it is over LLC company. Thank you for your advice.

eddie: Hey, For the new store, use the same interests that are currently working, but put them in an ABO, CBO's are risky on the first day. Add a few new interests too.

eddie: Hey, big hot hymen. Here's my advice: Okay, the priority is now to test new creatives , ASAP. No need to test single countries, no. But let's make 3 new ad sets targeting just AU, NZ, CA. Also 3 new interests targeting US, UK , AU, NZ, CA (not sure why you didn't test UK yet). Schedule a new CBO at $200/day for a new eligible ad set. Kill all new ad sets that got no sales today. Kill all old ad sets that got no sales today and are unprofitable in the last 4 days. Kill CBO#4 if it stays unprofitable today.

eddie: Hey, Going well. Start retargeting ads. Start abandoned checkout e-mails. Negotiate COGS with your agent. Start an ASC with the best performing 4-5 ads, top 3 countries. Test 4-5 new ad sets at midnight. Test 1 new CBO at $200/day. No need to kill any CBO. Kill all new ad sets that got no checkouts today.

Okay, you need to... start retargeting ads test 4-6 new interests & LLAs, duplicated from current winning ad sets get new content and test a batch of 4-6 new ads, like explained in the PDF kill CBO#1 if it's still unprofitable at the end of the day

No, I don't think creatives were the issue, but your new ASC is killing it anyway, probably just way more convincing, but we'll give it a bit more time to see. Kill CBO#2 tomorrow if it's not profitable. Kill all new ad sets that got no sales today. Kill all old ad sets that got no sales today and are unprofitable in the last 4 days.

Ty

eddie: Hey, Nice. It's holding up fine, looks like a down day but still good. Let's try to push it a bit more. 5 new interests, but also test Facebook or Instagram engagers 3% lookalikes. Create 1 more eligible CBO at $200/day. Time to create the retargeting campaign, start at $20/day and go up from there. Let's see if there's a resistance when we scale up a bit. We don't want to be spending just $1K/day. Kill all new ad sets that got no checkouts today. Kill all old ad sets that got no sales today and are unprofitable in the last 4 days. (edited)

eddie: Huh? What do you mean "drop so much"? It barely dropped. Don't worry about it. Let's test 5-6 more interests at $20/day in the ABO. Make another CBO with an eligible ad set at $200/day. Start the retargeting campaign (PDF), $20-30/day. And keep me posted during the day, you need to push those CBOs now, it's scaling time! You got loads of room here. Kill all new ad sets that got no checkouts today. Kill all old ad sets that got no sales today and are unprofitable in the last 4 days. (edited)

Before the page ban add to card rate was %5-7, but now it's %3-4 and thus cvr is too low around 1.5, but before the page ban it was %3-4. I created new creatives based as pdf and they were performed well, not bad as 5 out of 6 add to cart from ABOs came from new creatives, and 3 sales from new ones yesterday. Also they have lower cpc (0.7-0.8) than old creatives. Today is the second day of new creatives. I think if I can increase the atc % to over %7, they can become profitable. Thank you, always helping me and all of us every day. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Not much to work with here, man. I doubt your website's the biggest problem here. This might just not be a good product. If it was profitable before, you can try to ride this down time out since you're still breaking even in the last 7 days. Test 2-3 new interests everyday. But if you don't get profitable in the next few days, I'd cut it. Regardless, look for another product.

eddie: Hey, Yeah, under 2 ROAS at $2.2K isn't amazing but I'd still keep going with this. Sometimes, products like this wake up randomly one month and get to 5 figure days. You didn't let me know much about whether you included UK again, so... I'd suggest testing 3 more ad sets for top5, and 2 more for USA only, see if we can push it to work. Try (website) page views lookalike, 3%. Last 30 days. Schedule another CBO for tomorrow at $100/day for an eligible ad set, if you have any. Kill all new ad sets that got no sales today or at least 2 checkouts. Kill all old ad sets that got no sales today and are unprofitable in the last 4 days. I'd keep all CBOs. (edited)

eddie: Hey, before calling it a mid-winner, I'd test new ad creatives as explained in the PDF. Scaling new creatives with ASC is very effective. There's a chance it's your creatives that aren't convincing enough when FB starts throwing your ad around (at higher budgets) and stops cherry picking (at small budgets). Keep testing new interests though. Also test some 3% LLAs, like 95% video viewers and FB/IG engagers.

eddie: Hey, Flatulence parade. You NEED to start your retargeting campaign. Use a 50-day window for the data in your custom audiences. Start it at $50/day. Leave it on for 3-4 days before judging it, but scale it on the 2nd day if it's profitable right away. Make sure you're running abandoned checkout emails (PDF). Since the ABO is overall unprofitable, I feel like you need to focus a lot on testing way better ads (try new concepts). I know you tested them recently, but you gotta load up another batch in the next days. Try a different ad concept. I'd schedule 4-5 new interests, 3 targeting top4 (no NZ) @ $20/day, and 2 targeting USA. Try lookalikes in a day (so next midnight) for 3% - 95% video viewers and FB/IG post engagers. Kill ASC#1 if it's not profitable at the end of today. Reduce CBO#1 to $200 if it's unprofitable Monday. Kill CBO#2 if it's unprofitable Monday. Kill CBO#5 if it's unprofitable Monday. Kill CBO#6 if it's unprofitable Monday.

eddie: Hey, Argh, that sucks, man. Scaling down might fuck you up because of competitors, however... Not scaling down will definitely fuck you up because you'll have no stock in CNY, and you'll fully die. So I suggest you scale down (CBOs / kill them) and use your money to get stock so you can stay alive during CNY.
