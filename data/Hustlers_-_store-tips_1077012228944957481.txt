eddie: How to make free themes look beautiful using metafields! Honestly, you don't need to use paid themes anymore if you have a few pixels of brain & creativity. In this video I'll show you how to use metafields in order to dynamically customize every product in your store & make descriptions look clean. Benefits: 1. Faster loading time than crappy Fiverr dev work or using templates / page builders 2. Easier to do and manage 3. Looks beautiful 4. It's completely free This is a prequel to what we'll be doing in some of the hustler training live sessions, so make sure to fully understand the concept. Here's the video! Enjoy it, hustlers! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXcVn3YiGm4&ab_channel=eddie Sharing any content I post in the hustler group will result in a permanent ban.

eddie: Copywriting & product description tips 1. Customers don't trust you . They're already skeptical before they click on your ad, so you must take advantage of the first few seconds they land on your store to convince them to trust you & that your product will help them. How? Using social proof (a testimonial) and product benefits (research them the way I taught you) displayed via images & selling points. Stay on point, don't write stupid shit that leads nowhere and don't waste any space (such as using trust badges, writing too much crap, bad spacing, too large fonts). 2. No one has the patience to read long ass paragraphs! Focus on letting your titles explain your product benefits because they're the most important part of your description (besides images). Use paragraphs (under titles) to back up your benefits using your product's functionality. Most of your paragraphs should take 3-6 lines on an iPhone. 3. How do you perfect your titles & paragraphs? Write the initial information/idea you want to share in a few words (in a text file), and then reiterate it multiple times and shower it with product benefits (which you gathered after doing customer research). Perfect your title & paragraph and then integrate them into your website. Tip: Do this before you create your ads, so that when you make them, you have all the benefits & product angles lined up clearly for you to use.  (edited)
