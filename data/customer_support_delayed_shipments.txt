DELAYED SHIPMENTS & CUSTOMER SUPPORT - EDDIE'S TEMPLATES

SHIPPING TIME STRATEGY:
- Use 1-2 business days processing window (excluding weekends) for extra leeway
- Convert calendar days to business days to sound better (12-18 days becomes 8-12 business days)
- Create express shipping tier for higher profits
- Be transparent but cleverly embellish

UPSET CUSTOMER EMAIL TEMPLATE:
"Hey, CustomerName.
Thank you for contacting us, we'll be more than happy to help!

To be fully transparent, we did not expect to receive such a large amount of customers after starting the sale we've been running, and - while we are grateful - we've run out of stock a little earlier than we forecasted. I know, that's our fault, we should've planned better, and I apologize for that.

However, we've replenished our stock very recently, and your order is on its way!

It will take around <insert realistic shipping time> business days to get there, but I guarantee it will be worth it! The feedback we received from our current customers is overwhelmingly nice & encouraging, and I can't wait to get yours, too!

You can track your order at the link below whenever you wish, but I'll also be here to help you whenever. We're available 7 days a week!
<insert tracking link>

I appreciate your patience tremendously, CustomerName, and wish you a beautiful day ahead! ðŸ˜Š

FemaleName,
Customer Service Representative
StoreName"

PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
1. Customer feels heard by nice support rep
2. FOMO from stock shortage story
3. Relief that order is on the way
4. Excitement from positive feedback mention

EDDIE'S NOTES:
- Use sourcing agents after 10+ orders/day (YunExpress, 4PX)
- 2 weeks delivery is acceptable to customers
- Set expectations with intelligent disclaimers
- If customers won't accept explanation, use return policy leverage
