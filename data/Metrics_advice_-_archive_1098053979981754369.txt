Cinnamon Rick Roll: ‚Ä¢ product selling price - 86 + shipping & break even ROAS - 1.5 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product - 9 days ‚Ä¢ total ad spend - $498 vs. total ROAS - 1.38 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting - T4 ‚Ä¢ overall metrics (CPM - $14, CPC - $1, ROAS - 1.29) ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC - 17, IC - 15, PUR - 8) ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (PUR - 1 UK, 3 USA, 4 AU) ‚Ä¢ country spent - USA $164, 2.09 ROAS UK $134, 0.64 ROAS CA $46, 0 ROAS AU $158, 1.64 ROAS ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight - 8 hours left, $57 spent , 0 sales last 3 days.. (first 6 was profitable) Should i move on and fuck this product? I'm probably just wasting money at this point.. (edited)

eddie: Hey, After asking you to use the breakdown tool to show me the spend for each country what I've noticed is that the overall metrics look bad, but if we dig a bit deeper, we can see that USA was actually profitable , UK is draining money, Canada didn't get to spend much, and Australia is breaking even. Here's my suggestion: 1. Turn off all ad sets that are not profitable in the last 4 days. 2. Create 3-5 new ad sets at $20/day with the best interests you found & a new one - but only targeting USA, Canada, & Australia . Schedule them at midnight ad account time. (edited)

Crusty cameleon: ‚Ä¢ product 40$ with free shipping & 1.5 break even ROAS ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product - 4 days (CBO) ‚Ä¢ total ad spend 978$ vs. 1.5 ROAS ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting - US ‚Ä¢ overall metrics CTR - 4.3%, CPM - 12.9$, CPC - 1.13$ ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent ATC - 68, IC - 52, PUR - 37 ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS - 189$ VS 1.95 ROAS and 11 hours left ‚Ä¢ 1 day - BEROAS ‚Ä¢ 2 day - 1.92 ROAS on that day, I started increasing my budget and raised it from $100 to $400 throughout the day, but after changing it from $300 to $400, I noticed that it was performing worse, CBO spent ~$300 ‚Ä¢ 3 day - 1.23 ROAS the first half of the day went great, with several sales per hour. Then, it was only about 1 sale for several hours, CBO spent ~$380 ‚Ä¢Today is going well so far, I see that it's performing better today than yesterday, and I am happy about the high CTR at the moment of writing this, it's 4.0% I have no idea what to do next, I was thinking about lowering the budget but I'm not entirely sure (edited)

eddie: Hey, I see you're overall just breaking even, so that's not a great base to start scaling. And that type of mediocre momentum is likely to continue inside your CBOs, too. Also, not every day is going to be extremely profitable, even with correctly scaled CBOs but you see your first day with the CBO was breaking even, and only the second day was good. When you decided to scale on the second day, you need to also consider that this is not a super reliable CBO because it started pretty badly. So therefore you shouldn't have pushed as much as you did. Anyway, now that it's at $400/day, stay composed. Let it run at that budget for today (which is the 2nd day at $400/day, as far as I understand), and if it doesn't perform well, at midnight, drop it back to $300/day. If it does well the next day at $300/day, don't increase it. Just let it run and prove itself at that budget. If it does bad the next day, give it another day. If on this other day it does bad again, kill the campaign.

Cinnamon Rick Roll: UPDATE first day after changes - $74 spent , 2ATC, 2IC no PUR (dsl stayed on $148) all buying intent (2) came from canada and one adset where it spent only $3,27 (on canada) overall spent - USA $27 CA $12 AU $34 (edited)

eddie: As I see it, you got 2 options, either: 1. You test new creatives if you want to give this product a shot because it's shown some promise. But it will be a struggle. or... 2. You move on because clearly it requires a lot more work than a big winner. Remember, I don't know what your product is, what your website & ads look like, so I can't offer you advice on those.

I replaced UK with NZ for new T4 ad sets scheduled for day 4. - Everything went well until my winning creative CPM increased from $8 to $30+ (Canada stayed the same but low spend) on day 4! CPC increased to $1.64, I paused all ads now. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Ô∏è Disclaimer: Facebook glitched up today and spent everyone's money extremely quickly at a very high cost (CPMs), so metrics from today do not represent real data. What I see in your situation is that UK is not bringing in a good return, so... Every time you make new ad sets from now on: turn TOP 4 into TOP 3 and exclude UK always make 1-3 USA-only ad sets because there seems to be potential there On top of that, your break even ROAS is not amazing. After you make apply the advice from above, also try to work on lowering your COGS and testing different pricing (add shipping, increase price). Don't run all these tests at the same time if you want real data. Isolate. Let us know how it goes.

Fat boi chum chum: Day 1, I am only running in the US. Price, 54,95USD, beroas: 1.52

eddie: Hey, You spent too little to decide whether the product's good or not (I'm saying this without having seen your ads or product page, so I don't know those variables) . There's a bit of buying intent, but nothing special. I'd take a decision at around $70-100 based on whether you got sales or not.

T-rex but with short legs also: Hi @eddie Product selling price:$74, break even roas: 1.33 Ran ads for 2 days (3 including the day that fb ads were fucked-so messed up metrics a bit) Total ad spend: 240 (higher due to finding out about fb ads messing up late , total roas: 0.92 Countries: USA+top 4 Cpm: 33 ( I believe this number is too high due to fb) Cpc: 2.1 Roas: 0.92 Buying intent: 6atc 4ic 3pur (again I think numbers are messed up) Buying intent: aus, USA Spent $27 top 4- 1 pur Spent $214 USA - 2 pur (but I was only running USA first when fb messed up and added the top 4 after) Today ad spend: $36, today roas: 4.11- 1 hour till midnight So I first started with only usa ($20/day) but when I first looked at the numbers cpms and results were really bad- so I deleted all and only left the one with 1 pur and duplicated for similar interest. But then I found out that fb was overspending. So I decided to pause everything then add top 4 for 2 similar interests. Total 3 interest (2 top4 and 1usa running today) and I added 1 more USA/3 more top 4 scheduled to run tomorrow) thank you

eddie: Hey, Yeah, the glitch FB had on Sunday definitely messed up your metrics. It looks like today you were very profitable, but that could also be a fluke because you only spent $36. Scheduling ad sets in both USA & TOP 4 for the next day is really good, that's what I would've done. Now you're going to get more steady, reliable data. I would've created more than just 1 USA ad set. Your CPCs are a bit big in the USA (probably a little less if we don't count the glitch). Update us on how your metrics look in the next 2 days and we'll take a decision based on that data. It does seem like there's some life in your product so I'd definitely keep testing it. (edited)

Catalog of nude granny pics: Hey @eddie product selling price : $39.90 & break even ROA S: 1.5 for how many days have you run ads for this product : Day 1 (Supposed to be day 2 but FB was acting up the first day) total ad spend $229 + $74 (from first day when fb had problem), total ROAS: 0.60 countries you're targeting: USA & Top 4 overall metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS): CPM $18.42, CPC:$0.51, ROAS: $0.60 overall buying intent: ATC-21, IC-10, PUR-4 (one purchase was from Day 1 when fb was acting up) what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from: 3 purchase from USA and 1 purchase from Australia how much did you spend in total on each country: USA $140 (did not count the money spent on the day when fb was down) Top 4 $70 (did not count the money spent on the day when fb was down) & how much revenue did you make from each:USA = $152.94 Australia = $40.76 today's ad spend: $229 vs. today's ROAS: 0.60 I got over 21 ATC but only 4 purchases, how can i improve on this, any idea? How many times should i duplicate the adset which i got sale from? The ad set which i got no sale but only ATC, should i leave them on for another day or kill them?

eddie: Hey, This isn't looking good & isn't very likely to work. What I'd do for the next day is kill all ad sets that didn't have at least 2 checkouts, also kill the ones with less than 1.5 ROAS, and only duplicate one of the still profitable ad sets 1-2 times at most, while changing the interests to similar ones. If you're not profitable on the next day after scheduling these new ad sets, kill the product & move on.

Thank you! (edited)

eddie: Hey, This isn't looking too promising, but you have about 14 hours left in the day for USA customers to potentially buy. It's super risky, but I - personally - would leave the ads running until the end of the day because there's time for it all to turn around (now that Americans are waking up). Understand that it's super risky and it's likely that you'll burn through the budget without getting more sales, but there's no other way to know whether this will work because this is not a complete test. So, personally, I'd let them run for longer to see how the metrics look in US prime time, and if things don't get better, I'd stop the ads a few hours before midnight, ad account time.

Alex the gimp suit enjoyer: I launched this test 4 days ago, it's been profitable until today (screenshot is only the original test campaign), i think this is a common problem, so i'd like to see what @eddie would do, here are the stats: ‚Ä¢ product selling price & break even ROAS - PRICE: $59.99 BER: 1.6 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product - 4 days ‚Ä¢ total ad spend vs. total ROAS - $1,233.76 adspend \ 1.92 ROAS ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting - Top 4 ‚Ä¢ overall metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS) - CPM $8 - CPC $0.54 - ROAS 1.92 (overall) ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR) - 90 ATC\90 IC\37 PUR ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (if any) - USA, UK ‚Ä¢ how much did you spend in total on each country & how much revenue did you make from each - USA spent $908 made $1958. UK is the next biggest at $219 spent made $326 (AU and CA barely spent - 2 purchases on those) ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight - adspend: $330, ROAS 1.2 (made $423 in sales) day ended already - was not profitable this day, unlike the 3 days before which were profitable

eddie: Hey, finally a bit more data to judge! Your product's looking really good. UK's the problem. For the coming day: kill all ad sets that haven't been profitable in the last 3 days duplicate 2-3 of the most profitable ad sets & remove UK (leave it as just TOP 3). Target similar interests. make 1-2 more duplicates of the most profitable ad sets & target only USA. Replace the interests with similar ones (different from the point above). make 1-2 more duplicates of the most profitable ad sets & target only USA. Leave the interests untouched (we want to target the best interests now but only in the USA). Let me know how it goes (I can guide you more after this move, based on the metrics). (edited)

Big dick Mike the dyke: Hi ive been testing on a 50DSL $20 3 interest USA I turned these off at 41 spent as they where doing shit. But now I have scheduled 3 new interests. Do you think this was a good idea making new adsets. These results are from 18 hours running time. Product price $40 COGS 13 (edited)

eddie: Hey, Mike. Normally I'd say that you didn't test enough interests but, in your case, the CPC is way too high for the price of the product. It's extremely unlikely that you'll get better results if you test new interests because either your ads suck terribly, or your product is a bust. I'd move on (if I knew my ads & store were good).

Yeah, I swing that way: ‚Ä¢ product selling price & break even ROAS - $59.95 | 1.6 beROAS ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product - Day 1 metrics ‚Ä¢ total ad spend vs. total ROAS - $44.46 spent | total ROAS 0 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting - USA only ‚Ä¢ overall metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS) - CPM $27.19 | CPC $1.39 | ROAS 0 ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR) - 6 ATCs | 4 IC | 0 PUR ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (if any) - USA only due to me just targeting USA ‚Ä¢ how much did you spend in total on each country & how much revenue did you make from each (use the breakdown tool) - USA only | No revenue made ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight - $50 ad spent (low budget) | 0 ROAS | 6 hours until midnight (USA Central Time) ‚Ä¢ screenshot of the important metrics in the ads manager (optional) I know this is little spent, but some interests are doing terribly, and some are doing decent.

eddie: Hey, You've spent very little and only have 6 interests. Each of them spent $6, which is not enough to determine if the product's good or bad. However, you did get some buying intent, so there seems to be some interest. Personally, I wouldn't touch any of these ad sets yet and let them spend another day. Yes, even the bad ones. Why? Because the data you have is not statistically relevant (it's too little), so we don't truly know if those metrics are consistently bad. Let me know how it does in the coming day.

eddie: Hey, man. So here's the thing: unless your ads or product page suck terribly, it's a clear kill. Personally, if I had those stats - I'd immediately kill this product (but that's because I'm confident in my ability to make good ads & websites). So, check your ads & website against the examples I created in the training sessions - and consider killing this.

eddie: Dude... You're trynna sell a $15 product with Facebook ads. I don't need to look at your metrics to tell you'll never make profit with this. Turn your ads off & read the product research PDF.

Stained underwear at school: Hello @eddie ‚Ä¢ product selling price - $29.99 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product - Day 1 metrics ‚Ä¢ total ad spend - $48.46 spent ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting - USA + Top4 ‚Ä¢ overall metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS) - CPM $22.55 | CPC $1.46 | ROAS 0 ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR) - 1 ATCs | 1 IC | 0 PUR ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight - $48.5 ad spent (low budget) | 0 ROAS | *10 hours until midnight (edited)

eddie: Hey, Looks like the CPC is higher than what you said, it's $2. You'll never be profitable with a product that costs $29.99 with that CPC. Also, it's very unlikely your ads will be significantly better than now if you test new ones so I advise you to cut this product & move on .

isaecom: ‚Ä¢ product selling price AOV 81.24 & break even ROAS 1.35 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product 6 ‚Ä¢ total ad spend 584 vs. total ROAS 977 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting US ‚Ä¢ overall metrics (CPM 36 , CPC 0.97 , ROAS 1.67 ) ‚Ä¢ do your abandoned checkouts actually have customer data in them only 5 ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent ( ATC 38, IC 49, PUR 12 ) ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight: Today spend is 16$ and ROAS is 0, ad account is eastern time My problem is that I can't scale because I can't find enough interest, let's say one interest is doing pretty well so far with a ROAS of 3 and I've duplicated it and changed interests, but none are doing well. Now I'm trying to test new creative, but I don't know if I should turn it off or not. Maybe one day I get a general roas of 3/4 and another I'm in the negative.

eddie: Hey, Looks promising but I'm not 100% sure the reason it's not very profitable is because of creatives. Anyway, how to test creatives : test 3-4 new ones at a time. put them each inside a new ad set create 3-5 new ad sets (2-3 targeting current winning interests, 1-2 targeting new interests/broad) treat them like normal ad sets (kill what's unprofitable) if the new creatives are good, then some of the new ad sets should be profitable check which creative/s are getting the sales and pick the winner/s whenever you now make new ad sets, use the old winning creatives + the new winning creatives (and remove the old bad creatives What I suggest: keep testing new interests @ $20/day test TOP 4 countries, too kill what's has no sales or checkouts on the first day kill what's not profitable in 4 days You're spending quite little now but still are profitable. Stay composed. (edited)

(edited)

eddie: Hey, You spent very little, man. Just $20. The CPC definitely doesn't look too good and chances of it improving are pretty low, but cutting tests this early means you're not giving it any chance to potentially correct. I say just wait a little longer to $30-40, see if you get more buying intent. Options after waiting: test new creatives (I almost never do this because I am confident with the first batch I made) test TOP 4 countries also (check what the competitor's targeting) move on (safest option, but there's a chance you missed out on a product that could've worked with a little push)

Would you say to run this test for 1 more day with all new audiences and more narrow ones or just cut it? (edited)

eddie: Hey, man. No, I wouldn't run the test again with the same ads because clearly Facebook doesn't like them for some reason. Your CPMs are way too high. If you want to give it another shot, only do it with new creatives. Otherwise move on from this product. (edited)

eddie: Mike's randomly sending other people's metrics in here. So far, @Orphan tears , you're super profitable today although you've spent very little. It's looking really good. You forgot to write how many hours are left in the day for this ad account, so I'll assume the day's over. What I suggest is: duplicate the 2 ad sets that got sales and change the interest to a similar one don't kill any ad set, leave them all to run another day after $20-40 in ad spend per ad set, kill everything that got 0 sales Good job so far!

I have only got 1 sale from running this campaign for 3 days now (edited)

eddie: Hey, You've made $900 after spending $225, that means you're extremely profitable. The reason you're not getting sales every day is because you're spending very little and your expensive product obviously requires a lot more money to reach its cost per acquisition. Spend more, test more interests. Let them run for longer.

eddie: Hey, Not all products are big winners, some are mid. Some get saturated faster than others. Yours is likely in that position, and it's also pretty cheap. It's hard to make profit with products selling for $30. I personally made the most money with AOV above $40-50. Clearly this product isn't hot anymore and all indications point that it'll never work out for you. Cut it out immediately and don't look back.

eddie: Hey, Hook nose. It's not looking terrible actually. You're getting decent metrics so far & some buying intent. Of course, no one can guarantee that it'll work, but I'd definitely spend more on this. Especially because you only tested 3 interests. You need to test more to get a clearer view on whether there's life in this product or not.

eddie: Hey, Hook . The stats you shared here are wrong if you're talking about the same product as a few messages above. You turned the ads off at the right time, considering that you had some buying intent (according to your previous post in here). I don't think you should turn them back on because chances are way too slim for it to work. Too little action overall. I'd personally move on but that's because I'm confident I made the right ads and built the right website.

eddie: Hey, Capybara. The metrics look pretty bad, man. I'm not sure if it's because of the agency account. It's possible. The fact that you were making profit on the normal $50 DSL ad account does show some promise, but remember, it's small spend. It could have still been a mid winner with a few lucky days. Either way, I'd do the following: re-test it on a normal ad account (higher DSL than $50) use a few old winning interests and a few new ones use the winning post IDs and a few new ads based on whether it's profitable, either continue with it or move on without thinking back Don't put emotion into this shit. Let the metrics guide you.

eddie: Hey, You shut them down a bit early although it wasn't super likely they'd improve. Your CPC is pretty high so far so the ads might not be too attractive, however, you did get some buying intent so that's good. I'd keep the test going and re-evaluate at midnight.

eddie: Hey, Your CPC is a little high but it looks like your product has some life in it. You're probably about break even now or around there. I'd keep testing it but would make better ads first.

eddie: Hey, It's not a bad start currently. Forget the CPM for now, it looks like you're getting some buying intent. I'd leave it until the end of the day and judge then. Before the end of the day, I'd make 2-3 more, similar to the ones that got sales (schedule them for midnight ad account time), then I'd cut all ad sets with 0 checkouts.

T-rex but with short legs also: Hey @eddie Product selling price: 79 BER:1.34 Selling: 1 day Total ad spend: 50 total roas: 0 Countries:top 4+USA Cpm 18 cpc:1.06 roas:0 Buying intent: atc 0, ic:0 pur:0 Today ad spend 50, roas: 0 So I did 16 ad sets (8usa/8top4 @10/day each) I was wondering if I should wait little bit longer because I put alot of ad sets in but only spent 50 or should I get rid of this product? Fb generated 2700 impressions and 87 website visits but 0 buying intent. But Im not sure because all the products I've been choosing lately has similar results is it because I'm not letting them run lately or my products suck? I'm following all the criteria on ur pdf + using bigspy to see when the product was first heavily advertised by the brand I'm tracking (all within 3 months + 10k sales per day) Very confused if im doing something wrong, thank you!!

eddie: Hey, There's no clear indication that your ads are bad, so that means the culprit is either the product or your website. Sure, after spending $50, your ad sets haven't spent too much each, but you still got $50 worth of people on your website, from different audience pockets - so there should be some buying intent. Your problem is likely a bit deeper than just your ads if this is a common reoccurrence and it would be hard for me to tell you what it is without seeing the entire funnel. As for this product test, yes, you didn't truly spend enough but because there is 0 buying intent, I highly doubt you'll make this product work. So I'd personally move on.

I started the testing from 14 adsets (4 creatives per each adset) - 7 US & 7 T4. For the last 2 days, I launched a total of adsets 24. According to the killing PDF, I killed 14 adsets due to bad performace and low ROAS. So currently running only 10 adsets. 5 out of 10 launched by today. 2. Most of people buy 2 items 3. Currently loss is around $110 after reducing the product cost and ad cost.

eddie: Hey, man. Like I said, I never reduce the product price. It's like accepting defeat. It never turns out right. You say most people buy 2-3 but I bet the AOV's around $30. You can make them pay shipping for the $29 version and get free shipping for the $39 but even so, there's not a massive chance you'll get anywhere with this product. If you're not profitable today at the end, cut it.

(edited)

eddie: Hey, it's not looking amazing. I'll tell you what I'd do if I were in your shoes, as you asked, but remember that I don't mind burning money. I prioritize knowledge. I would... get rid of all interests with no checkouts schedule 2-3 more ad sets similar to the one that got a sale cut the product if I'm not profitable tomorrow Your CPC is big and I don't think it's promising. Chances are it won't turn around unless today was a fluke. So keep in mind that what I said above is risky. Safer options are either test new ads or move on.

eddie: Hey, your BE ROAS can't be under 1, by the way. Your CPC is surely also not $17. Let me answer your questions anyway: 1. There could be multiple reasons, but most likely it's loads of spies + window shoppers. Make sure to exclude dropshipping & AliExpress from your targeting. Other than that, really, ignore that shit and focus on ROAS. 2. Turn off ad sets that: got no checkouts the first day or $20 spend got no sales the first & second day or $40 spend are not profitable in the last 4 days or $80 spend How do you scale? You stop doing the random stuff you've been doing and you read the scaling PDF.

And for USA adsets with 04-0.6cpc but no buying intent, for a product at my price point at around how much spend should I turn off if no buying intent and cpc continues to be around 0.4-0.6?

eddie: Hey, Nice work, man. Based on your metrics and AOV, I suggest you turn off ad sets when: they had no checkouts in $30-40 ad spend they had at least a sale but then were unprofitable in the last $60 spent (for ABOs) Also, duplicate all the ad sets that did well and make about 4-5 new ones with similar interests.

My question is if I should continue running this product is it okay to turn those adsets on again? Fb reported those info after I turned them off. (edited)

eddie: Hmm... It's tough now that more spend didn't result in any more sales. You're getting some buying intent but not that much. I personally would run it another day because I don't mind burning a bit of money to conclude a test more clearly. However, understand that it's definitely a risk. When I find a winner, it's generally close to profitable, if not profitable, the first day. Yours is a bit far. For the second day, like I said before: they had no checkouts in $30-40 ad spend they had at least a sale but then were unprofitable in the last $60 spent (for ABOs)

I know in the PDF you say to cut ad sets with $3+ CPC with 10$ spent, but I am still waiting for them to spend $10. Should I cut the higher CPC adsets? (edited)

eddie: Hey, Your ads are bringing traffic to your website but your website's not converting, the problem could be there. A fat winning product doesn't require an incredible looking website to bring profit, however, yours might be a mid winner. So I'd say either improve your website significantly before you run your new ad sets, or move on.

eddie: Hey, man. Testing with a DSL is like trying to get someone pregnant with a condom on. You are definitely getting some buying intent, so I wouldn't give up this product just yet, but if you want to continue with it, test new creatives because your costs are too high.

Please let me know, thanks. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Granny pics. Your abandoned checkouts have data in them, that's good, that means your metrics are likely not infested by spying dropshippers. Buying intent is extremely good also. Focus on TOP 4 for the next ad sets you schedule, but still schedule 1-2 USA only ones using the best interests you've discovered (or similar ones if you tested those already). I'd say wait another day before you scale into a CBO. Good job so far.

eddie: Hey, man. You forgot to tell me what countries you're targeting but I assume it's USA. Yeah, there might be some potential but not with those ads. They're too expensive. If you want to maybe make this work, I suggest testing 3-4 new creatives. While you do that, get rid of most ad sets, leave just the ones with IC & PUR. No point burning money.

eddie: Hey, man. "Learning" doesn't mean anything, so you can ignore that. What I suggest is: turn everything off that got a sale but isn't profitable in the last 3 days turn everything off that did not get a checkout in $20 create 2-3 more TOP 4 ad sets (exclude UK) with similar interests as the winning ones, and schedule for the next day Let me know how that goes.

eddie: Hey, I'm happy to guide you. So it seems that AU & UK are getting decent ROAS. Interesting. I'd personally no give up on US though, it tends to pick up eventually even if it sucks at first; I've been in this exact position before. I'd say we should just continue working with TOP 4 ad sets for a little while, as they are. Don't remove any country (Canada spent way too little for us to determine it's bad). I say just get rid of all ad sets with no checkout inside $20 spent. Pause everything that got a sale but isn't profitable within $50-60 spent. Duplicate 2-3 profitable ad sets and try similar interests + a new one. (edited)

But even so since my product price is higher I'm still profitable even on the ad sets that only got one sale on the first day with around 40 total ad spend on the ad set. Should I keep creating new ad sets and waiting until I find more consistency before I scale? Because technically even my ad sets that only got one sale at the start still has roas of around 3. Thank you!!! (edited)

eddie: Hey, Yes, only scale ad sets once they profitably get 3-4 sales. Even that's not too much, but it warrants the risk a bit better. Turn off ad sets that got a sale only if they stop getting sales in the last $60 spend (6 days) - since your product seems to be profitable now. Keep creating 2-4 new ad sets per day consistently. Start using $20/day ad sets to get data quicker. Try a few ad sets without UK in them.

Until now I can say that I am not losing money and I am profitable. But my conversion rate is really low, like around 1% for the last 7 days. thank you!! (edited)

eddie: Hey, good amount of data to judge here. Let me answer your questions: 1. For ad sets that have initially gotten sales, I'd keep them running until they're not profitable in a 3-4 day window (or around $60 ad spend). Ad sets that get no sales initially but have a $20 or less cost per checkout, I'd keep them up to $40 spend and cut them if they don't get a sale. 2. The product's good and you're making about 20% profit based on the info above, which is good. Keep testing new interests every day and once Canada spends around $200 in total, if it's not close to being profitable, cut it out of all new ad sets you make. Good so far. Keep me posted and I'll keep advising you.

eddie: Hey, man. It's not terrible, and I wouldn't get rid of any countries yet. Just remove any ad set that got no checkouts within $10. Duplicate any ad set that you know at least 1 sale came from, 2-3 times, and pick a similar interest for the next day (which might be a bit late now that it's midnight in your ad account). I guess the best you can do now is just remove ad sets without checkouts within $10, and then see how it goes in the next 24 hours. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Turn off ad sets that have spent $20 without a checkout. I'd say make 2-3 new ad sets targeting just USA for tomorrow. Then based on the metrics, we can take a decision.

My price was $59. Surprising it was profitable for a few days but eventually i was in loss and found out about it couple of days ago. Since i changed the price some days ago i am profitable and some days im not. Anyway i found a few adsets which meets the criteria to be scaled in a CBO, should i scale them? What do you think? As im still not profitable overall, close to being profit. And im not getting any sales from Canada, should i remove canada from my adsets? Or should i move on to the next product? Note* Competitor is starting to scale hard. I did a mistake in the pricing so did that make any effect for the first 5 days? And if I scale with the CBO should I remove Canada and concentrate on top 3? (edited)

eddie: Hey, man. It's a bit risky to scale while you're overall unprofitable. I wouldn't do it until I'm profitable more consistently. But up to you if you want to take that risk. Yeah, remove Canada. Although it's little ad spend, it's more expensive to ship there so I doubt it could turn around. Also, you spent $773 and you're still not profitable. I'd give it another day and kill it if it doesn't turn around. Too much fuckery.

eddie: Hey, This is what happens if you only do half of the updated testing strategy. If you had also run isolated USA ad sets, we's know whether USA could work or not. USA only spent $15, so we got no clue. You also let your ad sets run for way too long. When you saw you got no sales around $50-60, you should have stopped the ads. You got 2 options: 1.

I feel like there is something to the product, as I am overall profitable for the 5 day period. I've been testing around 5 new interests at $20 per day, also i have 3 CBO's running. CBO #1 was super profitable yesterday (3.15 ROAS), and slightly profitable today so far(1.7 ROAS) (Started yesterday) CBO #2 started also yesterday, was slightly profitable yesterday (1.7 ROAS), but today it's unprofitable at (0.85 ROAS). CBO #3 started today, and is slightly profitable so far (1.73 ROAS) What should I do with the cbos? Do you think I should kill CBO #2 or give it until tomorrow? Should I kill any other cbos? Should I keep testing new interests and scale them? Also, I feel like this product has potential, but the incosistencies kind of scare me. What do you think?

eddie: Hey, man. I feel like you're torturing yourself for absolutely no reason by targeting Sweden. I agree that there's life in the product, but I'd try to find out what countries it actually would sell better to. If you want to stick to Sweden and struggle, at least test new creatives. You're more likely that way to find more consistent profitability, than relying on what you have. Also, have you set up retargeting (ads, e-mails)? Do you have upsells in place?

If I think some non-top-4 countries might like this product, should I test them along with the top 4 at the same time? I noticed that over 90% of the ad budget has been spent on one ad with a specific angle. Most of my other ads are using different angles. Should I start testing new creatives with this angle right now?

eddie: Hey, good job! Focus on adding 2-4 new USA ad sets daily. Once you get to $1-2K per day in revenue (profitably), start testing some TOP 4. After that, when you scale to around $5K per day, start testing worldwide. In terms of creative testing, yes! 1000%. Make 4 new creatives with the winning angle. Schedule them inside duplicated ad sets of winning interests. Also test them inside a broad ad set. Let me know how this goes!

Could you tell me what should I do? 2.What should I do with the big 4? (edited)

eddie: Hey, man. There's no way you're getting $4.41 CPMs in USA. Either you did something wrong or your ad account is glitched - but this is not a conclusive test.

eddie: Hey, You're telling me you got 11K ATCs? For the TOP 5, every new ad set you make, I say remove Canada. Also, when you say the CBOs you made didn't work, that could be for multiple reasons. How do you know they tracked all sales? If you do know the tracking was accurate, how much did you spend on each CBO before you decided they didn't work? Also, not all audiences are scalable, and on top of that, not all products are scalable. Ads could also only work when FB's cherry picking (at small budgets), but not be good enough to convince larger audiences (which have less affinity to your product). Any of these factors or all could be what's impacting your ability to scale. I wouldn't know which one without actually seeing them, of course. But based on what I said, you can try to work on each element and see which one helps you scale further.

eddie: Hey, Tickle my pickle. Your ads are the bottleneck here. Your CPC is way too high. I normally do look just at ROAS, but in your case it feels like you're not giving this product a real shot because of how much you pay per visitor. Create better, more engaging & convincing ads for this product, or move on to a bigger winner that requires less effort.

Thank you so much

eddie: Hey, I'd get a BM with higher DSL because it looks like you got a good product. However, if you really want to struggle, yes. Make more ad accounts. I wouldn't wait 2-3 days though, I'd run ads straight away or on the 2nd day. Also, I wouldn't run CBOs straight away on any new account. I'd revalidate with ABOs and then create scaling CBOs.

eddie: Hey, It's very likely that you're affected by the new changes too. Just kill everything that didn't get a checkout within $10 spent. Kill everything that got a sale the first day, but nothing for the next $30 in ad spend. Create just 1-2 new ad sets per day based on what works. Take it slow. Work on finding other products to stay productive, while you maintain this one.

And for UK when should I stop targeting since I spend 32.34 and earned 0 so far? Thank you!!  (edited)

eddie: Hey, I suggest turning off everything that has no checkouts inside $20 ad spend, and everything that has no sales inside $40. Turn off everything that made a sale but isn't profitable inside $50-60 ad spend. I'd duplicate all the ad sets that got sales and pick a similar interest at $20/day. I suggest adding Australia to the next ad sets you test. (edited)

eddie: Wow, I've rarely seen Canada get most of the sales. I'd say get rid of UK. Create new ad sets with just USA+CA, and a few targeting just CA. One of them - full broad (only CA). See how that goes and take it slow because you're currently losing money. If it doesn't get better in the next 2 days after making those moves, I'd probably move on. What's also important to keep in mind is that it's way more expensive to ship to Canada, so your mark-up is terribly handicapped.

eddie: Hey, sure. Yeah, I would've cut it at about $40-50 as well. Next.

eddie: Hey, baby bat . It's definitely quite volatile. Have you set up abandoned checkout e-mails? Personally, I'd just stay composed, cut all the ad sets that haven't been profitable in the last 3 days or that got no sale within $20 (to be conservative). I'd make 1-2 new ad sets per day and try to ride the bad wave a bit longer. If you don't get profitable within the next 2-3 days, cut it.

Just wanted to see what you think I should do, I just created abandoned email/sms campaigns. But when should I start doing retargetting ads? Once I get some tractions on the scaling CBOs? And what if the scaling cbo doesn't do well by the end of the day? Should I just scrap it but leave the adset in the testing? And what does it mean if the adset is still making sales but the one I duplicated for the cbo doesn't, what should I do then? Sorry for so many questions, but I'm trying to learn as much as I can so I know what to do now/in the future! Also, I have an adset that that has a roas of around 6 that been running 2.5 days (45spend) should I scale them now or wait for another day? Thank you again, appreciate you ‚ù§Ô∏è @eddie (edited)

eddie: Hey, Turn CBOs off using the PDF about when to turn CBOs off. I made one specifically for this. Same for retargeting ads, I got a PDF telling you when and how to do it. Both in #üìòÔ∏±knowledge . Treat each ad set individually. Why would you ever turn off one that still works just because of a failed CBO? Also, not all audiences, products, ads are scalable. So it's not unlikely for CBOs to not work sometimes. Don't scale ad sets that haven't spent at least $60 profitably (as explained in the scaling PDF). These are mostly general concerns that you have here, a trip into #üìòÔ∏±knowledge will answer them.

You think it's worth to turn off T4 and try only USA for one more day or would you turn everything off at this point? tyvm in advance

eddie: Hey, Mankini model. I'd personally turn off all unprofitable ad sets and run 1-2 more days targeting just USA+CA, using interests that are working well + some new ones. Just a total of 3-5 ad sets, to give it another shot. It's risky, but that's what I do. If you want to be safe, next it.

I have 4 sales in total, making up $210. My testing ABO is at $100 per day ($10 per adset, slightly different testing strat) On 2 seperate interests, i got 2 sales on each interest = 2 sales total Then for 2 other interests, i got 1 sale on each interest = 2 sales total Now i am left with 2 interest that I can potentially CBO Are 2 sales enough at a 20.00 spend (thorughout 2 days) to create a CBO for an audience? If so, should i create the CBO for both interests at the same time, or 1 CBO per day Thanks (edited)

eddie: Hey, No, definitely not enough. Read the scaling PDF, it'll tell you when you should scale into CBOs. Right now you're not even profitable. Stick to testing new audiences and cutting off bad ones.

eddie: Hey, Amazing first day! My big stores sometimes have way worse performance on their first test days. Let me give you some advice. Kill everything that spent $10-20 without a checkout from the first day. And now schedule 2-3 new ad sets for midnight, targeting similar interests to the one that got sales. Also make another new ad set targeting the same audience as the one that got sales, but narrow it down by gender (if your product is gender specific). You can also make another ad set, the same way (but all genders), and narrow down by the platform that got the sales (IG or FB) in terms of placements.

Yesterday I put 2 of those adsets + 1 from two days before into a cbo with 100/day spend. I'm still overall slightly profitable but the adsets I scaled yesterday were literally 5-6roas consistantly. Not sure what I should do now. My first adset I scaled two days ago (fb ads stopped spending randomly while I was asleep, it got one sale at the end of the day but decided to keep it going because that ad set too had a roas of 4.8 so didn't want to give up yet) what should I do, super confused... Thank you @eddie

eddie: Hey, Could be a bad day today, but still turn off any CBO that's under break even. I'd also turn off all ad sets from today that didn't get at least 1 checkout per $10-15, to be more conservative for tomorrow, and all ad sets that haven't been profitable in the last $40 ad spend.

eddie: Hey, Mice man. I don't think this is just a bad day to be honest, your cost per ATC is also higher than it should be, not just the cost per purchase. I'd either move on, or turn off all ad sets without a checkout, and duplicate the one with a sale just 1 time, using a similar interest for tomorrow. Risky move, but that's my advice. Safest move = next.

eddie: Hey, It's looking pretty bad. If you want to still give it a shot, kill everything that didn't get sales, duplicate the ad sets that did get sales and use new similar interests for tomorrow (so 2 new ad sets). If tomorrow sucks, move on.

Secondly, $29 is very low. You won't have much room to scale. 2021 was 2 years ago. Costs increased since then. I'd get rid of all ad sets with no sales within $20 spend, no checkouts within $15.

I can't advise to do what I'd do in your situation, because it's very risky, but - personally - I'd wait a bit longer to see if I start getting sales now that Americans are awake. Chances are it won't get better, but I'd be fine with another $20 lost for me to find out 100%. But remember now that I got no clue if your website's good or bad, so who knows if you're having a big bottleneck that could be turning those customers away.

You got decent buying intent but I don't think you can go too far with this without optimizing the ad creatives you use. 1.75 BE ROAS for the second variant is also not great.

eddie: Hey, Looks like today you're profitable, maybe because of the adjustments you made on your store. But still, I'm not feeling super hopeful because you've spent quite a lot so far, unprofitably. Personally, I'd try with just USA, and give it another day. Kill everything that's unprofitable in the last 3 days or has no checkout within $10-15 (trying to be conservative). If you're not profitable overall today and tomorrow, it'd probably be better to just move on. There are products out there that require way less struggle than this.

This is on a newly warmed-up ad account so is this normal to have dog shit results? Is it worth testing with new creatives or will i just keep burning money

eddie: Honestly, I don't see much hope in this one. I'd move on, unless you want to let it run another day with just 2-3 ad sets. Up to you.

eddie: No, this is a clear skip. Should've ended it sooner honestly. Way too expensive clicks and 0 buying intent. It's dead. Learn from this. Next.

My daily ad spend has more or less stayed the same. I have been adding new 2 ad sets every day and have launched 2 CBOs. However, I usually have to turn off about 2 ad sets per day as they become unprofitable in a 3-4 day window. The two CBOs were very unprofitable in the first day, one had 0 sale and the other had 0.79 ROAS, so I had to turn them off as well. I haven‚Äôt been able to reach 1k days while my main competitor is doing 10k days almost everyday (they launched in January). I also noticed that my campaign‚Äôs overall frequency is 1.19. Is this within the normal range or is it something I need to be concerned about? I also noticed that Facebook is spending less on my ‚Äúwinning ‚Äú creative and more on other creatives. Is this an indication of creative fatigue? And this is probably a very leafy question, please forgive me. How do you overcome anxiety and stay composed when you are at a loss? Do you get used to it and become number when you experience it more? Thanks again

eddie: Hey, Hmmm... it sounds like you're running at about 20% profit. Now that's not super scalable itself. Personally, I still think you could push it if you find the right audiences (to scale in CBOs) because you said you only tested 2. However, if you want to do this the right way, then you test more creatives before you scale. You minmax and improve your website a bit too (social proof, videos, etc.). Your frequency is fine, but make sure to exclude buyers in the last 180 days from your new ad sets. FB will spend the most on the best creative you have, don't worry about it. Just test more creatives. I know the exact feeling you're talking about, it used to hurt me too, but you must understand that you can't turn this up and down performance chart into emotion. Look at your sales on the Shopify graphic in the last few weeks. Every little spike down means you get anxious, right? But you see that each time, the chart goes up immediately after. It evens out. Let your brain understand that & don't let it react based on incomplete samples of data. I hope this helps.

What do you think? if you were in my shoes what would be your next move? Please guide me and i found some profitable adsets should i put them into a CBO?

eddie: Hey, I'd say remove the product and work on your website. Scale down and stay conservative with the budget because currently this isn't looking great. If you're not profitable after the improvements, next it. No need to keep burning money on difficult products.

eddie: Hey, You're selling a product for $170 so you have to wait a bit longer and accept more risk (to lose more money). You got some buying intent, but I'd wait for around $110 or so before taking a decision. If you get no sales within that time, I'd turn off.

eddie: Personally, I'd start getting rid of TOP 4 ad sets if they get no buying intent by the middle of the day and run the USA ones a little longer because you have some buying intent. I wouldn't spend more than $60-80. Up to you how much risk you want to tolerate.

eddie: Hey, $50 DSL It's not looking good either way but I can't judge because I got no clue when your ad account stopped spending and how much it got to spend during USA prime time. Either way, it's not giving me much hope. Low buying intent for the price. I'd next it but you can give it another day if you want to give it a better chance, and spend just $50 that day (24h).

eddie: Hey, You'll have to edit your message. Currently you're saying your overall ROAS is 3+, which is really good. You don't need to tell me that FB didn't track sales because that's normal (especially without Wetracked).

Now, I‚Äôm still wondering if I should continue this test. It‚Äôs been 7 days, 3.5 days since the relaunch, and my conversion rate / AOV is significantly higher ($77 instead of $59 first price) after I implemented quantity breaks. I must say that I‚Äôm aggressively testing creatives (every day), and testing out new audiences (only women bought, so targeting them combined with age etc). Got a few stable ad sets bringing in sales daily at a pretty good roas (2.5 and higher, two at 5.0+) with like $60-$80 spent each in total. Today I set up remarketing/re-engagement as well. So in a nutshell, I'm at breakeven right now. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Why would you be doubting this product? It sounds like since you revamped everything, things aregoing well. Today you're at 3.1x ROAS, which is amazing. That's like 30%+ profit margin. You're on the right path, but stop spam testing creatives. Do it more thoughtfully, and not every day. You have to ride the wave a bit more too. Add abandoned chcekout e-mails and start retargeting too. Good job so far.

eddie: Hey, Yeah, I don't know your site or ads, so I can't tell if that's the issue, but I'd say start being more conservative if you want to give this a last shot, meaning... kill everything that doesn't get a sale within $15 leave just the profitable ad sets on for tomorrow + 1-2 new ones improve your website (social proof, better wording, better images with clearer selling points) If it doesn't become profitable tomrrow, cut it.

eddie: Hey, You picked a product that's a bit higher priced than usual ($40), so although it's painful, I don't think you can draw a clear conclusion without spending about $100. It's risky, and there's a big chance nothing will come out of it. But that's just how it is with products that sell for that price or higher. They require higher risk tolerance. If you get no sales after spending $100, cut it.

eddie: This looks terrible, man. One last thing you can do, check in the ads library where your competitor's running this product (which country), and try the same (probably Top4). Otherwise, it's next.

eddie: Hey, man. It's looking good so far. I wouldn't cut ad sets with just $10 ad spend right now. I'd say if they got no checkouts in $30, I'd cut them because this product's a bit more expensive. For tomorrow, duplicate the ad sets that got sales and use similar interests. Looks like you might have something but we don't know for sure until you spend a bit more.

eddie: Hey, man. You only spent $27. We can't judge anything from that You're running on a BM with DSL so you're not gonna get anywhere like that. My suggestions on spending $60/day were for BMs that increase their DSL in 2-3 days. Get some more data if you want to analyze metrics properly. You got too few interests, too little ad spend.

eddie: Hey, Yeah, it's not looking good, man. You are getting some sales though, so I feel like maybe if your ads + store were better, you'd be profitable but it's hard to tell without seeing those variables. Safest option: Kill this product. Risky option: Kill every ad set that got no checkouts or sales after spending $20, and any ad set that did get at least a sale but is not overall profitable in a 3 day window. Schedule 1-2 new ad sets for tomorrow. Your call.

Since it's a new bought BM I only ran 3x20 today. Would like to add another 60-80 dollar for tomorrow and give it a better chance. I really don't understand this insane CPM. The competitors are all just ripping the main competitor's ad and doing pretty well, I haven't ripped anything and did my own ads and getting fucked by FB like that. I thought about trying to remake the ads and maybe also borrow the ad from the competitor and schedule them for tomorrow with slightly different targeting audience. What do you think about that? Do you have any suggestions or tips maybe? Thank you in advance!

eddie: Hey. Your CPM & CPC are a little high. At midnight, get rid of everything that spent $15 without a checkout or got no sale at all. Add 2-3 more ad sets (similar interests to the one that got a sale) for tomorrow. Play more conservatively because the costs are high. We want to see if they get better tomorrow.

eddie: Hey, man. You are profitable, but your ads are bottlenecking the funnel in my opinion. Your website & product must both be very good, but the reason you're only at about 18-20% profit is that your ads don't reach enough people (not engaging enough) and they don't get enough clicks (badly presented benefits, weak CTAs). I say start testing new ad creatives, and use the new PDF from #üìòÔ∏±knowledge to do that. In terms of what I'd do now, I'd cut everything with no checkouts in about $15-20 ad spend, and no sales in $40. Cut ad sets that have been unprofitable in the last 3 days. Schedule 2 new interests for tomorrow, and one ad set targeting Australia alone - broad. You can schedule a CBO for the 2nd interest in your screenshot, too, at $100/day. But it's a little risky because you're not extremely profitable overall, so it might flop. But I'd focus on creatives while I cruise and make profit using the advice above.

The CPC is so high so idk if I can make it profitable in the long run. Do you think the costs would go down if I would've given it few more days? Problem is that this product is fairly new and there is only a few clips on the internet, so I'm a bit limited when it comes to making ads. Now I found 2-3 more videos on the internet I could make new ads from and could give it another try. What is your opinion? Thank you (edited)

eddie: Hey, Dude, your CPC is massive! I don't think the costs would go down, no. If you want to run this product I suggest using different ads. If not, skip.

eddie: Hey, man. It's dipping but it could just be a bad phase, it happens. Every week or two weeks I get a few bad days. But that's not guaranteed what's happening to you, I'm just letting you know it could be the case. Your ad spend's also a little low, but I can't tell you to increase it because it's a risk. Did you do USA+AU only on new ad sets, like I said last time? I say you cut everything that's unprofitable in the last 3 days, and everything that got no sales today. And only add like 2 more ad sets for tomorrow, USA + AU.

eddie: Hey, Honestly, it's a little grim. It looks like you're slightly profitable today, but very little. I personally wouldn't give up on it yet. I'd keep optimizing the ad sets, getting rid of bad ones and building more and more profitable ones. You scheduled 2 ad sets tomorrow, that's good. Just be more conservative because it's not very profitable. Don't jump into CBOs. Improve your product page too, I don't see why more people aren't converting. But I assume there's more work to do, use the advice I gave today in the live. Tomorrow's Monday, generally a little sucky. But if on Tuesday it doesn't do better, focus on another product.

eddie: Hey, Your CPMs & CPCs are a bit high, so your ad creatives are probably not the best. You also seem to have marked up the product like 5-6x. I wonder if the product is even worth what you sell it for. I'd say try way more engaging creatives and more aggressive CTAs to get more clicks. If after that you're not profitable, I'd move on.

eddie: Hello, Okay, it's a bit tricky. Considering you had inconsistencies, I'd ride this period out until you get back on track. It'll take 3-7 more days, in my opinion - because you're spending very little. I know exactly how these interruptions affect performance, and it usually comes back if you force it a bit. It's really good that you're profitable through this time as well. I'd still create new ad sets every day, new interests + reviving old good interests. I'd cut out every ad set that gets no sales after spending $40, or no checkouts after spending $10-20 (up to you how much tolerance you have, I'm okay losing a bit of money in favor of recovering performance a bit quicker). After 3-7 days, you should look at the country targeting and consider creating new ad sets targeting just the profitable countries in the last $2K-4K ad spend.

eddie: Hey, man. This isn't looking great, honestly. I'd say shut most ad sets off, you're burning money. Leave profitable ones over like 2-3 days, to be conservative. Your creatives likely suck, the costs are a bit high. Safest bet, either move on or make significantly better ads.

eddie: Not bad. It's nothing wrong with your results over $114 for a product of that price. There's not enough data to conclude a test in that range. I don't like giving this advice, but realistically, you need to spend more to figure out if it's a winner or if you just wasted money. simple as. Kill everything with no ATC. Schedule 2-3 more ad sets for tomorrow with similar interests as the ones with buying intent.

And should i try CBOs this weekend? One adset is doing good spent $48 with ROAS of 3.0 or should i wait till it spends $60?

eddie: Hey, man. I'm not liking this much. $400 spend and still not profitable. Remember there are products there that explode on day 1. If you still want to run this product, I wouldn't target only Canada. Canada's a shit region to sell to, and I don't think you're even too profitable there either because it's a lot more expensive. Making CBOs is also not a great idea. This product isn't scalable. You can do the same thing I suggested last time, with about 2 new ad sets, or move on.

eddie: Hey, You can schedule 1-2 ad sets for just Canada, but usually those don't perform. You have to make USA/AU profitable ideally, I'd test some new ad creatives. I also suggest improving your website, I think this is the biggest issue here . Make sure to clearly explain HOW your product will help the customer, don't just say it will. Valuable tip for everyone who reads this: Use CNE-express to ship to Canada. It's WAY cheaper.

eddie: Hey, man. Stop worrying about the damn conversion rate. This is what you'll do now: Your ads are seen and clicked on by loads of people, we don't need them all to convert to make money, but we can do better by: starting re-engagement & retargeting ads (very important) e-mail marketing flows e-mail campaigns Another important thing for you is to get your COGS lower. Find a better factory to get shit sourced from and negotiate with your agent (or use mine - #üì¶Ô∏±reliable-agent ). Then, you're already making decent profit, so scale some of those good ad sets from your ABO, into single-ad set CBOs. 2-3 new CBOs for tomorrow. Another thing: Test T5 ad sets now. And then next, test 20-25 countries (T1 and some T2). This is also very important. You do all of the above and you'll notice a gigantic improvement. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Oh, you had a good day, huh? Big surprise. Why don't you freaking listen from the beginning, you leaflet? Anyway, don't scale so quickly after you just made a change and had a godo day. Combined with changing the website, too. Way too many variables. Leaflet move again. Just cut all the ad sets that are unprofitable and make 1-2 new T5 ones + 1 USA one if you got a good one to duplicate.

eddie: Hey, man. It's hard to judge the metrics when you target ePacket because the costs are diluted. You were close to being profitable, so with some ad creative, website, and country targeting optimization, you might become profitable. But that's all I can say from your metrics. Not sure it's worth pushing this instead of something that's more likely to work.

Thank you again for your advice, you've been great!! (edited)

eddie: Nice, nice! No, I wouldn't increase the budget of that CBO yet. Yesterday it didn't even do well, there's a chance sales will stop once you increase. You need to wait until it spends more & gets more sales. Maybe tomorrow if it still does good. Keep finding new audiences to test, 2-4 new ones per day.

Appreciate the time you take to answer all questions. Been here for a few days. Grasped all the PDFs from knowledge, literally read everyone's metrics here before launching and this is is my first $92 day ever! I messed up when launching, instead of 12AM the ads launched at 7AM eastern time but still was able to generate this. After reading so many of your responses in metrics, I have killed the adsets with ~$10 + cost per checkout, duplicated the ones with sales with similar interests, and scheduled for midnight. Only one USA & T4 adset got a sale which is still on BE point, and one adset is on 3ROAS. Making all decision based off of UTM data from shopify! Your advice would be highly appreciated! @eddie

eddie: Hey, it's normal to not be super profitable on the first day, but honestly, the issue here is also your price. Making good money on FB with a $29 product is extremely difficult. I try to stay away from prices like that because it's an uphill battle. It also looks like there's not enough buying intent even at that low price. I'd personally suggest skipping this product, but if you want to - you can leave it another day to know for sure. I doubt this one could turn around though.

eddie: I don't like saying this, but you spent too little and stopped it before USA even woke up. Those are broke moves. If you want a real answer, you need to let it spend (and potentially burn) more money. The metrics you have now are not statistically relevant.

eddie: Hey, Nice, I like it. Good progress. For Tuesday, let's schedule 1-2 CBOs for the best interests that have over 3 ROAS. Then, inside the ABO, we make 4-5 new ad sets at $20/day, half new interests, and half similar. Slightly move, we're aiming for a 1.8 ROAS for that day because we're trying to expand a bit and see more of what works. Let me know how it goes.

Pick 2 ad sets that... got at least a sale today and are the most profitable within a 4 or 5-day window (after spending at least $55) And put each inside its own CBO at $100/day. Then, duplicate your 3 best ad sets, switch the interests to similar ones and... Make 2 more ad sets with your best interests, but targeting just USA. Schedule all for tomorrow.

Don't think I ever had a better first day of testing - it was even slightly profitable. Although, fb recorded 8 conversions instead of 6, and also attributed them to wrong adsets compared to UTMs. One thing I have to note, the product's perceived value is very likely under $50 (I also charge shipping), so I'm considering lowering the price and increasing shipping price to get a better CR (since I only got 6x ATC, IC, PUR, I guess a ton of people immediately dismissed it due to price). I don't know if that's a good idea? Also, should I leave all adsets running for another day, or turn off those that bring no buying intent by mid day?

eddie: Nice, man. Well done, it's going good. Let's keep going like this. Kill every ad set with no checkout within $10 or unprofitable in a 3 day window if it got no sale today. Add 3-4 new ad sets with similar interests, duplicated straight from the working top4 and US ad sets. If tomorrow goes well, for the day after, add shipping cost. Start with a $3.5. (edited)

eddie: Sorry, Nipples. I missed this. Not bad. Keep all ad sets with checkouts and sales. Add 3-4 more for the next day with new interests.

eddie: I'd give it another shot and if it's unprofitable, kill it.

eddie: Your profit margin isn't amazing, I'd try to get lower COGS or test better prices. Meanwhile, kill any ad set that had no checkouts on their first day. Make 3 new ad sets with similar interests to the best performing ones for tomorrow.

eddie: Hey, The main issue here is your price. I wouldn't recommend advertising products that go for under $35. It's a losing battle, 99% of the time. Make sure to read the PDFs in #üìòÔ∏±knowledge where I talk about how to pick products. Secondly, targeting just Australia lowers your chance to make a product profitable significantly. It's a shot in the dark. Make sure to read the FB ads product testing PDF from #üìòÔ∏±knowledge and watch the video I made that comes with it. Check the other people who posted their metrics in here, those mistakes happen often. Some of them corrected them and got really good results.

eddie: Okay, big boss man. If this was me, here's what I'd do: leave the break even CBO on another day kill all ad sets with no checkouts in $15, and not profitable over 3 days. make 2 new ad sets with new interests targeting USA only at $20/day make 4 new ad sets with the same winning interests you have now, targeting top 5, at $10/day Doing this is likely going to result in a loss of money, but good gain of data so we can make better decisions. That's my suggestion. After you do this (if you're not a pussyboi, of course), share the results so we can optimize. Other than this, I don't know anything about your ads or website, but I'm sure you could improve them a bit to get more profitable.

eddie: Hey, To clarify, the full strat still requires just 1 ABO. No, it's okay to send metrics earlier than that. Not a bad first day. I say get rid of all ad sets that did not get 2 checkouts today. Duplicate the ones with 2 sales and use similar interests, schedule for tomorrow. Add 1 more ad set with a new interest.

eddie: I can't give you advice on single markets because that's not a strategy I recommend (unless it's an extension of your WW store). Anyway, what I can tell you is to use broad interests, and no interest targeting + the same scaling CBO strat. Guys, if you want advice, follow the PDFs.

Lazy labia: Hey @eddie here comes day 2! overall, the testing campaign is slightly profitable, but not by much. However, there are some profitable adsets in there. Judging by the data, canada and australia doesen't seem too good, since there are no sales (1 in australia). Should I run only UK and US and remove Australia and Canada? Also, i have an adset which has 3 sales, should i try a CBO with it?

eddie: Hey, I would not say remove CA and AU because they barely spent $2-3 per ad set. It's not enough to decide. No CBOs yet either. Just kill what got no checkouts today and is unprofitable in the last 2 days (so if you got no checkouts on an ad set today, but overall it's profitable because it got sales yesterday - keep it). Duplicate the best 3 ad sets and change the interests in them for tomorrow.

eddie: Nice, nice! Let's duplicate the best USA ad set 3 times, pick a different similar interest in each ad set. Schedule for midnight. Do the same for a Top 5 ad set, but just 2 times. Try charging shipping. Kill anything that's unprofitable over the past 2 days, or today's ad sets with no checkouts at the end of the day. Based on how it goes tomorrow, we may scale.

Brooklyn flatulence parade: Hey Eddie I followed your advice from yesterday. I am slightly profitable today there is about 4 and 1/2 more hours until midnight. I‚Äôve only had three larger sales today. 2 which came from my best interests from yesterday. Maybe time to scale those?? One has a 4.3 roas and the other had 3.2. They both have been running for 3 days. My only concern is that I have a dsl of 250 and idk how that works when trying to get it raised? I don‚Äôt want to loose momentum.

eddie: Hey, Not bad, but why are you spending so little today? Let's get rid of ad sets that spent $20 without a sale, and ad sets that only got 1 sale within $60 ad spend (and are unprofitable overall). And schedule 2 new USA ad sets for tomorrow with new interests, and 2 new TOP5 ad sets with old, proven interests.

eddie: Hey, You're still not charging shipping? Let's get rid of all ad sets that have not been profitable over a 3-day window, even new ones. And let's schedule 3 new USA-only ad sets with new interests for tomorrow, and one US+UK new interest too. No scaling yet, ask customer support to increase your DSL first.

Can you confirm if my analysis is right? Ad sets as per the testing PDFs that should be killed: [ ] day 4 ad sets, due to only 1 purchase and amount spent over $60 [ ] day 2 ads sets, without any cost per checkouts ‚ùì2. As there are only 3 winning ad sets should we keep testing interests to see the viability of the product OR setup remarketing as we've got 466 view contents OR both ‚ùì3. With targeting top 4 or 5, without using the geolocation app customers get all the way through to the checkout and only see USD, I know for Australians this would cause friction with the customers. When was the last time you tested multi-currency i.e. with geolocation? ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è again thank you, just trying to download your brain so i can think for myself, win, and then help out more here. cc: @eddie

eddie: Hey, 1. The PDF is just for general guidance. I deal with ad sets differently based each situation, depending on overall profitability, selling price, et. 2. I'd just keep testing new audiences and set up abandoned checkout e-mail flows (PDF about this in #üìòÔ∏±knowledge ). 3. I never use geolocation, it's a shitty app. I sell 5 figures per day every day to many countries and only process in USD. So you shouldn't worry about this. For your current metrics, kill all ad sets with 0 sales in total on day 2 kill every new ad set with no sales today same advice about creating new ad sets as last time because.... Last time I advised you to make some Top 5 ad sets and I see you didn't do that. I can't guide you through this if you don't take my advice.

eddie: Hey, It's tough to say this but, personally, I'd wait and burn some more money. You do you but the first day isn't always profitable, and some winning products hide behind stats like these. I'm not saying your product's a winner, I'm saying that it's still possible for it to be good, but you won't find out unless you spend a bit more and potentially see how it goes on day 2.

eddie: Hey, It doesn't look too good. I guess I'd leave it until the end of the day too, and if there are more sales, I'd give it day 2, as well. But if you get nothing until the end of the day, it's a skip.

eddie: Hey, man. See, that price point is a pain in the ass, but you're not too far from being profitable. Honestly, I doubt that this product will go far, the price is low and your CPC is high (probably from having bad creatives). I don't know if your product's perceived value can support a better price, so it's hard to tell you to increase it. There's a chance this will work out - but it will require better creatives and a higher price (maybe charge shipping). For now, I'd personally leave it running longer, but with what I explained above in mind - I doubt it'll turn around.

eddie: Hey, At the moment, this doesn't look scalable at all. Either the product is the problem, or your website. I wouldn't give up on it just yet, I'd work on the website - adding more social proof and better copywriting. If it's a functional product, focus on explaining clearly WHY & HOW it works. So that it clicks in your customer's head. In terms of ad sets, kill every new on that got no sales today. Kill every ad set that's been unprofitable in the last 3 days. Add 2 more USA ones and 1 top 5 ad set with new audiences. That's my advice, but again, nothing's guaranteed + I'm not able to see your actual funnel to give you more in-depth advice. Currently, you're not losing money, so it feels to me like there's some potential still. Now, it's up to you what you do.

eddie: Loads of emojis You put quite a bit of effort into this and you're just breaking even overall. From this data, either your product isn't scalable, or you're not marketing it correctly (especially on your product page). Is it a functional product? Are you clearly explaining the logic behind the problem it solves, and how your solution clearly fixes it? <- This is major, if you don't get this done 100% right, all products look like yours. Either improve on what I said - and significantly so, or skip to the next. Other products require less effort.

eddie: Hey, It's tough when you sell something at that price, because you have to burn a lot more money to see if it works. I'd say $200+ to get at least a (first) sale. I can't tell you to keep burning money though because it might end up not working (which is generally the case), so it's up to you. I don't think testing it on a higher DSL would turn those stats around at this point also. I'd spend over $200 and burn it if it gets nowhere, but you take your own decision.

eddie: Hey, We only care about what Shopify says, not FB. Loads of things could be wrong, some are: markets not being turned on people losing trust on the way to paying (which could be the cause of an unconvincing website or ads) the product actually not being a proper winner or being saturated buying intent from other dropshippers, and not real people You spent enough now, got no sales. Skip this one unless you feel like you can improve ads & website significantly .

eddie: Nice, very good first day. I'm not loving the BE ROAS though, but hopefully you can negotiate it better later. For now, kill every ad set that got no checkouts. Duplicate the 4 ad sets that got sales (or less, but make sure you end up with 3-5 new ad sets) and use similar interests in them. Schedule for midnight. Let me know how it goes.

eddie: Hey, Looking fresh. Add new PROVEN ads only to ad sets that dip in performance (around break even for a few days). Turn your best 2 interests into CBOs for tomorrow, try $200. 3+ ROAS is not sustainable, if you want real money, you scale until it drops to 1.8-2 BUT ... Another issue you're having here is your break even ROAS. Terrible. 1. Test a new price. $59. Right now. 2. Negotiate your COGS, it's not good. After you fix those things: Yes, test 5-7 new audiences per day, and lookalikes now too. Start testing 3% - 95% VV, 3% - FBE, 3% - IGE (engagement).

eddie: Hey, yeah, sounds good to me. I'd give ad sets with checkouts within $20 another day. So I'd let them spend $40 (if you're hopefully spending $20/day per ad set). And yes, your BE ROAS is atrocious.

The product is fresh but even before publishing I kinda had a feeling that I'm overpricing it. I think the amount of add-to carts proves it (they don't go into IC) 3. The product is for women but I'm targeting both genders - does it mean that I need to spend more in order to make fb realize that it should focus on women? 4. My plan is to skip it after the $100 spent if I don't get more purchases. What are your thoughts on this one? Thank you. (edited)

eddie: 1.69 BE ROAS. Awful. Unscalable. Normally, I'd leave this running until $100+, but I don't see any way you'll be able to scale this profitably.

According to PPSPY that website is making around 5k a day. Their website is extremely basic, not much description or detail (the type of products should have a lot of technicals listed on the product page), They posted 2 random posts when opened the Facebook page and that's it. Also, their homepage banner is kind of random (ex. you sell pet products, and the banner is literally the picture of your cat with nothing else on it). I saw another couple of websites selling an old Variant of this product and seems to be a good sale for them as well. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, the main difference I think is the budget, target audience, and type of video. My ads are more like "don't miss out buy now (showing how the product works)" and theirs are "showing the product without pushing the sale in the video". what do you think I am missing here? (edited)

eddie: Under $9 CPMs in USA? Are you sure you're optimizing for conversion - purchase, and not something else? If you're saying you almost had a sale but their card was declined, I'd give the product another $30-40 to see if it turns around.

I schedule 5 new adsets for tomorrow at $10 for all(top 4 adsets working the best): 3 top4 and 2 USA only. Any more advice? (edited)

eddie: Hey, Don't kill the interest that was doing well before just yet. Give it about $30 ad spend first. No, don't kill the ad sets with high CPC. Focus on profitability, like this: Kill only ad sets that got no sales after $20 ad spend, of if they're still at $2-3 CPC after $10-15 (and 0 buying intent). Very good planning for new ad sets. You're learning. Proud.

eddie: Sweet, we're looking fresh & clean. I like it. You need to negotiate COGS (wait another week before you do that, and if metrics look good, you ask me in a Q&A how to best negotiate. I gotchu.). 4 more ad sets for tomorrow, duplicate them from the current best ones, at $20/day - new interests. Less though if you got a shitty DSL. Kill everything that has no checkouts inside $15 (and no sales). Leave the ad sets that had sales yesterday but not today on.

Wish I was Eddie's boyfriend: Hello Eddie here‚Äôs my day 1 update NEW BM $60 spent 2 Adsets targeting USA $20 each, 2 Adsets T4 $10 each My metrics below, thank you for your help product selling price & break even ROAS: $44.95 / 1.3 BEROAS for how many days have you run ads for this product: 1 day total ad spend vs total ROAS: $60/ 0.76 roas countries you‚Äôre targeting: USA UK AU CA todays metrics (CPM , CPC, ROAS): $28.43 / $.76/ 0.76 roas do your abandoned carts actually have customer data inside them: still need to figure out how to see overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR): 5, 5(Automatically takes to checkout) , 1 what countries are the buying intent coming from: USA UK CA 1.75 hours until midnight. Its a healthcare product, different variations of videos, although 6 months old product though.

eddie: So here's the thing. 1. You can't do shit with a DSL. 2. Health products are very hard. 3. Old products are also hard. I don't see this going too far, but hey, you got a sale. The first day metrics aren't terrible. There could be something behind it. It's hard for me to give you advice though because I'd say, schedule 2-3 more ad sets. But you can't do that because of the DSL. All I can say is kill the ad sets that got no checkouts or sales, and replace them with new interests. Stop using ad accounts with DSLs, guys.

eddie: Hey, let's see! Personally, I'd run this test longer. It's not profitable, but you manager to get 2 people to buy 2 sets of 2. That's decent buying intent. At the end of the day, kill every ad set with no checkout. Make 3 more ad sets for tomorrow, similar interests to the ones with sales. Schedule at midnight. If tomorrow you're not breaking even or profitable, you kill it.

eddie: Hey, Why are you at 2.2 ROAS when your BE is 1.3? You should scale until your ROAS drops to like 1.8 or so, at 20% profit margin. There should be room to go up to $14-15K/day. That way you build a larger audience to retarget & e-mail as well. Run an ASC for the best mix of creatives you got. Test new creatives with ASC & scale them. No clue what you're doing for upsells, but you're selling $6-7K per day, there's room for more profitability there. Do 2 post-purchase upsells.

eddie: Hey, Looks like there's potential. What I'd do now is tweak the website with better images, videos, and copywriting. That'll help you be more profitable, Also, it's a bit weird how USA is not doing that well but don't remove it from targeting yet. It looks like you had a bit of a bad day, don't freak out. Pause new ad sets that had no sales today. Pause ad sets that have been unprofitable after spending for 3 days. Make 3-4 new ad sets with new interests related to the product. And work on getting better COGS. 1.5 BEREOAS is high.

eddie: Man, your break even ROAS is 1.8? You'll struggle with this product bad! But it does look like people are interested. I don't know what it is, but maybe the perceived value allows you to increase the price a bit? You can't go anywhere with 1.8 BEROAS. Also, why all ASC? Test interests in ABOs, scale with CBOs mainly. Messy so far. Follow the strat in the PDFs. I'd also test another product. (edited)

eddie: Hey, Yes. 1.5 BE ROAS is still bad and not super scalable. Aim for 1.2-1.3, especially for a product as cheap as yours. Add upsells. Add 2-3 more e-mails in the abandoned checkout flow. Test a new price. Test charging shipping. Scale with $100 CBOs and raise their budged as explained in the PDF.

eddie: Hey, Interesting, I feel like your website's the issue here. Your ads do have fairly high CPMs, but you seem to get a decent amount of clicks, however, they don't covert well enough. Revamp your product page (better pictures, better copywriting - use the training store as example) while you scale down, kill every unprofitable ad set. Then test 3-4 new ad sets, same countries. See how it goes. If it's not profitable, then either the product's not a winner, or your website needs much more improvement that your experience can't provide at the moment. And it that's the case, you move on for now.

I scheduled 3 new ABO ad sets for tmrw. Should I set up a re engagmenet as well? And after that's done my first CBO? Thanks a lot man *it's still the same product I told you * (edited)

eddie: Heyyy! Let's see. Nice, nice. Moving to USA only targeting's a good move. Next moves: Cut new ad sets with no sales & less than 1 checkout per $10-15 ad spend. Cut ad sets that had no sales today (but had sales in the past) and have not been profitable over a 3-day window. Add 4-5 new ad sets for tomorrow targeting new interests. Start a retargeting CBO with 1 ad set (re-engagement). Run it tomorrow at $15/day. No CBO just yet, let's see how tomorrow goes. Extra advice: I think you should also spend time looking for another product while you run this one, because I don't see longevity here. I see it as a learning opportunity. (edited)

eddie: Alright, we'll stick to USA only. Make sure you got 3 abandoned checkout e-mails. Okay, it's super risky to start CBOs now because the ads are crawling, not doing amazing. I say make 3-4 new ad sets for tomorrow, new interests, and... Check the overall ROAS in 2-3 hours, if it's over 2, then make a CBO for tomorrow with the best interest that you have, that spent over $60 profitably. Also, test new ads if you want to give this a good shot. Try an under 10 second ad where you write just 1 sentence on the screen (the main benefit).

eddie: Nice, nice. Good work. IF you get a better DSL, then... Let's do a CBO for tomorrow for an ad set that spent over $60 - pick the most profitable one. $100/day. If not, I suggest you keep going with ABOs until your DSL goes up. Yeah, I personally wouldn't give up on USA yet, a lot of times it turns around after you spend more. I'd schedule mainly new top4 ad sets for tomorrow, and only 1-2 for USA only.

eddie: Not bad! Let's duplicate the ad sets that got sales for tomorrow (5). Switch all interests for similar ones. Cut ad sets that got no checkouts or sales, end of day.

eddie: Hey, I'd say kill everything that got no sales, regardless of checkouts. Make 3-4 new ad sets for tomorrow with similar winning interests, coming from duplicating the best ad sets you had today. Too early for country breakdowns.

eddie: Hey, USA isn't converting, that's a very bad sign. You got some lucky sales from AU, nothing reliable though. The issue here is most likely your ads. High cost per click, even though you target T5 countries. It looks like there is some potential with this product, but if you want to make it work, you're going to need better, more convincing ads.

eddie: Tough one, expensive product. But not enough (real) buying intent. If you want to squeeze every chance of it working, you let it burn another day. Your website could be the problem (CPC looks good), or the product is a bust. Safe move: Next it. Risky: burn another day

eddie: Man, either your website's shit or the product's nothing special. You're still profitable but it's a pain. You got retargeting? Set that up with ads and emails. Add upsells. And trust me, find another product, too.

eddie: Hey, I'd say your product page must be the bottle neck here. The is probably also not the hottest thing. I say change the pictures on your website with one that explain your product's main benefits more clearly. Optimize copywriting as well, check people's comments on your ads and see if you can pick some ideas from there. Turn off every ad set that's unprofitable in the last 3 days. Even new ones that just spent $20. Add 1-2 new ad sets with new interests for the midnight coming after you made the changes from above. And if you're still unprofitable after that, cut the product and move on.

eddie: Hey, Absolutely beautiful metrics, my boi. UK seems to be killing it way better than USA, oddly. What I'd do is... 1. Make 2-3 new USA only ABOs, we want to see if we can force USA to work. Schedule for tomorrow. 2. Make 2-3 duplicates of your best ad sets, switch the interests. Schedule for tomorrow. 3. Make just 1 new CBO per day (if you have eligible ad sets for it). We take it easy since it's a newer ad account without that much history. 4. Add abandoned checkout e-mails (PDF). 5. Create re-engagement ads. 6. Add 1-2 upsell products + install Reconvert - #üîßÔ∏±quick-links . This is the move. Keep me posted, we'll scale this hoe together.

Do you mean by using an app like Klaviyo for SMS/Email marketing or is it something else? Appreciate your help!

eddie: Hey, Gassy. You spent $30 total, right? Due to spend issues. 1. Personally, I think you can't judge anything based on this data. Not only is the spend quite low, but it's unreliable due to bad pacing (from your spending issues). I'd try a different BM at this point (I think you already switched ad accounts, but I don't remember). 2. You check in the orders tab on Shopify, then click Abandoned checkouts - and you look through each to see if customers entered data in them or left before doing that.

eddie: Hey, Interesting. Personally, I think the price point is an issue. You might think it's not because you sold a few $K per day, but that's the reaosn you didn't sell $10K-20K per day. I'm sure the perceived value is at the price point you picked, so you got no choice for this. You're already waiting for new creatives, so that's great. That's one of the most important things when you run VSLs, in terms of longevity. Secondly, you said e-mails are set up? But are they? Are you sending campaigns weekly? Do you have all flows set up? Are you adding new products regularly in order to upsell more? ^ Probably not... Anyway, nail the creatives, set up what I said above, and also look for another product to scale higher with.

eddie: Hey, Really good first day. Na, don't kill ad sets with high CPC. Kill all ad sets with no checkouts. Duplicate 3-4 ad sets that got sales (T4 and USA) and switch to new interests. See how metrics are tomorrow. It's possible your ads suck, but let's see tomorrow. If it's still looking decent, its worth making new ads with more aggressive CTAs.

eddie: I personally wouldn't give up yet. I'd keep killing unprofitable ad sets and continue making new ones targeting just US + AU. If it doesn't turn profitable in the next days, kill it. That's what you do if you want a real answer. If you want to be safe, kill it now, but I wouldn't. I'd want the real answer + to learn.

eddie: Niiiiiice. We're making really good progress here, my boi. Alright, no scaling just yet.

eddie: Hey, Not bad so far! Just a bad day today, no problem. Let's kill every ad set that only started spending today & got less than 2 checkouts. Duplicate your 2-3 best ad sets for tomorrow, switch the interests to new ones, target USA only, schedule for midnight. Now again, duplicate your 1-2 best ad sets for tomorrow, leave the interests as they are, target the top 5 countries (USA, UK, CA, AU, NZ) schedule for midnight. All new ad sets you make should spend $20/day. Let me know how it goes. We'll adjust based on that.

There's a ton of different options on Amazon, and there are lots for cheaper price. I don't see it advertised on facebook THAT much. I'd say I'm in the mid-high price range. One of the major "flaws" I have is that I don't show the actual product in the ads, but the customer definitely understands what the product is. I'm just showing a problem from a persons POV and telling ppl to go get one for a discount today. My website isn't bad although there's definitely room for improvement, as always. I stopped the ads as of now, so I'm just trying to understand what the metrics tell you. Is something not convincing enough? Price too high? (edited)

eddie: Hey, Weird how massive the CPM is but CPC is pretty low. I'm thinking the ads are causing you the biggest problem here. They're hella boring to watch, people skip = big CPM. But who watches more, clicks = low CPC. If you want to make this work, you need way better ads. Otherwise, next.

I tested new creatives, it's giving me similar results but got sales from 2 different creatives whereas from the first batch i was getting sales from only one. Today so far I'm profitable, i have another batch of creatives ready to test, should i test it in the same ABO campaign? or use ASC? And should i exclude Australia and Canada from my top 4 adsets and just concentrate on US and UK? What do you reckon? Please let me know what should i do further. Thanks again for all the help, really appreciate it!!!

eddie: Hey, man. I feel like you got a good product here, but your CPC is too high. You really need to start testing a lot of new ads. Different types too. Try a batch of 4 ads of 9:16, then try 4:5. See what works best, then keep testing stuff like hooks and angles. Retargeting also - emails + ads.

eddie: Hey, Don't test new creatives yet, wait a few more days, test them around Friday, Saturday. And about the countries, just duplicate more of the ad sets that work, and turn 2 of them in UK+US, we'll see how that goes. Retargeting e-mails and ads might help you make this more profitable also.

eddie: Hey, man. You're spending too little. 1. Test more creatives 2. Make 3-4 new ad sets with new interests every day. Also add lookalikes. $20/day per ad set. 3.

The only competitor is a new Amazon store which started a week ago and started making organic sales. Ordering the product myself to create original content will be necessary as it's a new product. Currently, using existing videos. - Just to clarify, I use Facebook Ad Library for product research but also explore other platforms for emerging trends. Noticed high interest and scarcity, so I gave it a try. (edited)

eddie: Hey, I'd give it one more day to turn around, and cut it off if it doesn't. Kill all ad sets without sales. Make a few more targeting USA alone. Your CPC is a bit high, might be the ads.

eddie: What's up, Curved peen? Nice, looking beautiful so far. Let's duplicate 2-3 new ad sets and try new interests. And duplicate 2-3 more, and run lookalikes: 3% 95% video viewers, 3% Facebook engagement, 3% Instagram engagement. Bump up the retargeting campaign's budget. Make 1 new CBO with your best performing ad set (which isn't already turned into a CBO). Once you get 3 profitable sales on a CBO today, add another $100 on top.

It is the one that i hit my first 5k/day and then next day facebook randomly disabled ALL my ads and i couldnt get it up and running for atleast 3 days, then after that i got falsely DMCA and my whole website was shutdown for a day, then my paypal got banned (i have it back now). before when i hit my first 5k/day i was mainly targeting usa/EU (other top 4 countries didnt bite) and had couple very solid cbos running, and i had alot that i couldve done (i believe i couldve hit 10k if it wasnt for all the shit). but after all that, i basically had to start from 0. I tried the same ads etc from when it was working but they ALL couldnt be revived. Not wanting to give up, i started testing alot of things (new creatives, constant testing for new cobinations of interest groups,targeting etc etc) Then after around a week of slightly profitable but at lower ad spend (due to paypal and other issues) what ended up working and picking up was targeting EU and richer asian countries (singapore,hk etc) and up until 2 days ago, i was doing a consistent 2.5k/day for a week, and it was starting to show some promise again. then just yesterday and today all my cbos/adsets etc suddently started to perform really bad. It was a very abrupt change (within a day) right now im on my second day and it has started off really bad again. Right now i would love your advice on what you think i should do next to potentially get it running, I have been learning alot but im not sure what to do from here, i am sorry this is a VERY LONG, but i havent posted in here in a while because i wanted to put my head down and try to figure some shit out myself first, but THANK YOU for all your advice, this is truely the best discord out there (i joined a couple other ones but they were all soft and everyone was asking leaf worthy questions so i fucked off)

eddie: Hey, I think you're just having a couple of bad days, no reason to panic at all. I started today awfully too, spent $500 and made $300. So what. Stay composed, let it play out because you have enough that tells you this product is profitable (look at the last 7 days). You'll need to learn that out of 7 days, 1-2 will be bad, on average (depending on your setup and product). Your real metrics are the OVERALL situation after a week, 14 days, 30 days. You zoom out, calculate it, and see if you're profitable, what %, etc. That's the real data. So what you should do right now for this product is stay composed, keep testing new creatives, new aspect ratios, new types of creatives, new demographics, etc. Find what works best. And also find 1-2 more products to test on a different hybrid store, you can't rely on just this one for Q4.

eddie: Hey, You have to keep testing new ads though, that's one of the only ways to stay consistent. And of course, retargeting, which you said you'll do soon. Improving your BE ROAS would help too, lowering COGS. Other than that, it's just a shit day, stay composed. You spent $68, nothing to expect from that little. Keep testing new interests, use famous female actor and models, magazines, etc.

eddie: Hey, not looking amazing. Product/website are the potential issue here. I'd work on the website. Making more convincing ads is a big lever even if your ads aren't exactly the problem. I'd kill CBOs 4 and 5. You can't afford letting them run at this rate. Maybe leave 4 but even so, it's tough. You're barely profitable. Find another product while you make improvements to your current product page and run completely new ads.

(edited)

eddie: Hey, nice work. But there's room for better here. You got an amazing opportunity and you're not milking it. 1. Negotiate COGS. Tell your agent (mine if you work with her) that you'll be able to get a lot more orders for her if she saved you a bit of money. 2. Increase price to $39 + shipping. 3. Use a credit card. 4. Test 5-7 new interests in the ABO campaign per day, and make 1-2 new CBOs @ $200/day out of the best audiences in the last 4 days ($80 ad spend). 5. Ride the momentum. Add $200-1000 extra budget on the CBOs that do good 2 days in a row but only increase during surges of sales. ^ do this and you'll be at $10K-15K/day in a few days.

eddie: Hey, Not looking too bad, CPC is a little high though. Also, you left Australia out, which is a good country. I say kill all ad sets that got no sales today after spending $20, or no checkouts after spending $10. And see how it goes tomorrow.

eddie: Hey, man. I think your website could do better, you should improve that. Add some better images, some social proof, and tweak titles. Other than that, you need to make new ads work or you won't get far. If no new ads work, then you might have picked a saturated product that got lucky in your hands, and it's just running on momentum now.

eddie: Hey, man, your today's ad spend makes no sense.

eddie: Hey, Looks like there's some potential but your ads are a bit too expensive. I'd try a different aspect ratio and better hook, clearer call to action. Example: If you're running 4:5, try 1:1.

eddie: Hey, No, cut it and move on. Ads aren't hitting, buying intent is low. Chances are it's dead.

eddie: Hey, Ignore CPMs. Negotiate COGS. Add 4-5 new ad sets using new interests (try to think of completely new stuff, like if you sell shapewear - target McDonald's, Burger King, etc.). Schedule 1 CBO for tomorrow for the most profitable ad set in the last 4 days (which also got at least a sale today). Start retargeting ads according to the new PDF in #üìòÔ∏±knowledge .

eddie: Hey, Let me decypher this. Looking fresh! Nice first day. Duplicate 4-5 of the best ad sets, switch interests. Do this for tomorrow too, if it goes well again. Test USA only ad sets too.

eddie: Hey, Bad day, but... I think your website's lacking. Add better content, fix titles, add more sections (us vs. them type of stuff, testimonial, etc. - can't give you more advice on this because it heavily depends on the product). Other than that, although you're getting a really good cost per click, I still think you should test new, more convincing creatives. They make a MASSIVE difference in scaling with CBOs. Look at this screenshot, these are all CBOs & ASCs, and they all have a wide range of creatives in them. It would've never worked if I didn't constantly come up with new ideas for ads. Some new shit I make literally switches up the performance completely, from $20K days to $40-50K. Anyway, that's what you gotta focus on.

eddie: Hey, here's advice: 1. Both, you can focus on both. 2. Dude, use fucking Mercury. Why you playing games? Use Mercury and they'll increase your limit, just ask. They increased mine to $80K, and I could ask for more, but I don't have cashflow issues. And here's the thing, it's not even a "monthly limit", although customer support thinks it is. It actually resets as soon as you pay it, which gives you a lot of flexibility. I pay it daily and it resets daily. Apply it to your situation, take advantage. 3. Then improve it. You're working with my agent, right? Improve whatever sucks, and increase your price. 4. You shouldn't be at this ROAS. I understand you've got some cashflow issues, but you never know when some shit'll go down and you can't sell this anymore. SQUEEZE IT now. While you still can. Scale until you're at like 1.7-1.8 ROAS. Make millions, not pennies.

eddie: Hey, Looks like your ads have engaging videos but your website isn't selling. Either the website is shit, or the product is shit. Either way, bust.

eddie: Hey, I see you only got 2 ad sets, that's nowhere near enough to take a decision, I'm afraid. You got some buying intent, I'd say try another day with new ad sets. Double check copywriting & images on the website, see what you can improve on meanwhile.

eddie: Hey, I don't understand, why are you on a steady decline, and 10% margin? I see this week you're at about 25% profit margin, according to your numbers. I'm confused. Anyway, let's say you are actually going down (which is definitely not visible in those metrics you shared), you need to test new creatives. Every 7-10 days, run completely new batches creatives in a test, as explained in the PDF. Make them different each batch, not just tiny changes. They need to be radically different. Test different aspect ratios for some creative batches too. This alone will take out of this "decline" you say you're in. Run more USA-only ad sets too. Those usually scale better.

eddie: Hey, Clicks from FB don't mean visitors, but it could've been a glitch on Shopify's side anyway. But you won't get anywhere with this product with a $1.8-2 CPC. You're selling for $30, man. You really think this can be scaled? The only way you could make this happen is if... you test a shitload of new ads until you get one with better CTR & CVR you improve your website's images + copywriting you add upsells, post-purchase upsells test charging shipping Otherwise, you're wasting your time.

eddie: Hey, Not bad actually. But you should've ran the whole testing strat. You spent just $110, which is little, especially for a $90 product. Add 5-6 more interests (a few for top 4, a few for USA).

eddie: Shiiit, we're doing fresh now. Okay, Add 5-6 more audiences for today, test some more lookalikes too. 2 new CBOs for the best performing ad sets from the ABO, I'd say start at $200/day. Give CBO 5 another chance, kill if bad. Switch CBO 4 to $200/day if it does well today too, after 3 sales.

eddie: Hey, not bad. Ads are too expensive though. Add upsells. Test more ads until you find a batch with higher CTR & better ROAS. You won't get anywhere with $2 CPC for a product that doesn't convert that well (so far).

eddie: Hey, not bad. I wouldn't actually kill any of the CBOs. The move to take to the next level: Test batches of 4-6 creatives per week according to the PDF and scale their ASCs. + continue bumping up eligible CBOs. This should take you to $10K/day.

eddie: Yeah, this is clearly a matter of bad ads. I'm sure with better ads you'd turn this around. Obviously, I got no clue if you're capable of creating better ads (with actors) or not, or if you're willing to make the effort to do so - but I think that's the only way you could save this product, if you wanted to.

Initially, both you and I had reservations about that product is not good enough, but we decided to give it another push. How does it look now? At the moment, we've decided to slow down a bit and are currently testing three ad sets along with one CBO. The metrics have significantly improved because the product is well suited for home decor at home. We're also in the process of receiving the product to create additional content since we've exhausted our existing resources. For now we just left one country USA. One more note that we have a product for $60 and we give bundle 2 products for 90$(Good price? Cause they picking this bundle mostly). One product cogs is $20. So, what are the next steps, do I need to implement retargeting? (edited)

eddie: Hey, I can't tell you if the price is good because I don't know your product. But yes, it does look like it could be a mid winner if you try some new ads. Focus on testing a batch of ads every 1-2 weeks. Also, test other countries too, you never know where the sales come from.

eddie: Hey, Although you're quite profitable, I'm not sure you can push too far with 1.68 ROAS. You should focus on testing more ABOs before scaling. Get e-mails ready.

eddie: Hmmm... Your CPC is so low, your ads must be very engaging but not super convincing. Your move right now is to test more ad creatives in batches of 4-6 every week or so. There's a bit of room to scale to about $3K-5K/day but new creative testing (a explained in the PDF) is what's going to take you further. Focus on that, until then, we can't do much but ride the wave you're already on.

eddie: Good start so far. I see you're warming up, so let's focus on adding 3-4 new ad sets with new interests, 2 should be USA only. We'll see how it goes after that, hard to judge from such little spend but good start.

eddie: Sorry for not seeing this. I see you're stuck at about 15% profit margin and low scale. All your efforts now need to go towards testing new creatives using the creative testing PDF. It's literally the main reason I scale like I do. Keep CBO 2 as retargeting fuel. Could've kept CBO 3 for the same reason but no big deal. Test. New. Ads. Batch of 4-6.

eddie: Sorry for not seeing this. There's potential here, but it's hard to tell because you spent very little. Kill ad sets that got no sales. Schedule 4-5 more ad sets with new interests for the coming midnight.

What is going on? Also I have what I think are theoretically good adsets for a scale? i attached img of that. the roas is likely higher than reported on those adsets.

eddie: Man, I honestly don't see this going well at scale. And I don't think those ad sets will do well as CBOs. Your CPC is so high and I think those last 2 days when you were profitable were just random. If you really want to keep going with this product, you must try new ads.

eddie: Hey, Pig skin. Hard to tell you what was wrong without seeing the ads, product, website. Show them in Sunday roast (this sunday).

eddie: Beautiful! Alright, don't turn off Top5 ad sets yet, keep them until midnight. If any gets a sale, duplicate it for tomorrow + change interest. On top of that, we got lightning here, so... Schedule 6-8 new ad sets for tomorrow, new interests $20/day, each. 3 CBOs at $200/day for tomorrow also, using the best interests you have - each inside one CBO. Tomorrow also, when the current CBO gets 3 sales profitably, raise the budget to $200/day. We're scaling this shit to $10K/day.

eddie: You got buying intent, but you haven't tested too many interests yet (because of the warm up). No solid metrics though, so it's a risk how you go forward. You do you, but personally, I'd keep testing new interests to see if I can get some momentum going. But it's a risk, like I said, because you're quite unprofitable currently. Just not bad enough for this product to definitely be a bust.

eddie: Hey, man. Don't freak out about the CBOs not bringing crazy ROAS, they're more realistic than the ROAS you get at low budget. You're crazy profitable still, so we can push more. 1. Add 5-6 new interests for tomorrow. 2. Create the retargeting campaign (as in the PDF). 3. Schedule another 1-2 CBOs depending on current winning ad sets in the last 4 days. 4. Kill ad sets that were unprofitable in the last 4 days, or NEW ad sets (made today) that got no checkouts after spending $20.

eddie: Hey, man. Why are your ad budgets at $20.44? Also, you're just targeting Denmark, man. As I said, this channel is for people who follow the strat I teach, not random do random stuff. Either way, it looks like there's some potential (although you spent very little) so I'd make 3-5 new interests for tomorrow.

eddie: Hey, USA's waking up now so it should pick up soon. Your stats in the last 7 days look good. I'd wait until the end of the day to decide on what to do. If you're profitable add 4-5 more ad sets. If not, add 2-3 more. Regardless, you won't go far without better ads, so work on that.

eddie: I'd wait to $50-60. If you get no sales - cut it.

eddie: Low buying intent. 1 checkout. $114 spent. No sales. It's a bust, man. Probably bad product choice, seeing as the CPC is decent.

I've been testing new creatives every week

eddie: Hey, yeah. I've had some shitty margins too lately, but it's all good. 2 BE ROAS though for the last variant. Big ouch. Adjust or your margins will always suck, even for 2 units. Your main focus right now needs to be new creatives, especially new types of creatives. Like new ideas, new formats. Fully focus on that, it's the only way to really increase performance but also make sure to adjust COGS . Test lookalikes too.

Can't grow a beard: Hey @eddie ! I risked and tried 3 new interests at $20 a day and these are the metrics from them for one day (15.10).

eddie: Heyyyyy, look at ayou, dude. Well done. You didn't add the country revenue, but here's what I'd do: Duplicate all the ads that got sales 2 times, add new interests, schedule for tomorrow. Kill every ad set that got no checkout. Eaaasy

eddie: You got a good product here. Imagine if you didn't steal creatives, it'd probably actually be profitable. Go make your own damn ads, dude.

eddie: Hey, Either your website (images/copywriting) is shit, or your product's not a winner. I can't tell, because I can't see any of it. Looks like there's some potential there... Not sure it's worth spending time improving the website or, instead, just finding another product. Depends on how capable you are to do the first.

eddie: Damn, so here's my advice: 1. Test 20 or so new countries in new ad sets, with your best interests. 2. After that, test new ad creatives. 3. Make new ad creatives for retargeting. Ride the bad wave, it be that way sometimes.

eddie: Damn, got a fatty, lucky sale (possible fraud). Hmm... $1.84 CPC though, low buying intent. Although you're profitable, I don't think it's looking too good but we should try to push a bit anyway. Make 3-4 new ad sets, new interests similar to the one that got you the sale. Kill ad sets with no checkouts after spending $20. (edited)

Should I duplicate the new ad set which brought me a sale 2 times with different new interests and schedule them tomorrow? Thank you again (edited)

eddie: Hey, man. A lot of data here indicating your creatives are running out of juice, and - potentially - your website sucks. ^ these are the best 2 things to work on (use the creative testing PDF) Other than that, test new products. This doesn't look reliable.

eddie: Hey, you're unprofitable currently, CPCs quite high. You didn't write the revenue in country breakdowns. Make new ad sets targeting USA only if sales came mostly from USA (you didn't share this, so I got no clue). I say give it another day, and if you're not profitable tomorrow (3-4 new interests), then either make new (way better) ads, or next.

Testicle pudding: @eddie For context, I switched this to another website as the other one got hit with 20% payment hold from shopify and 10% from stripe. The new one has a good history over 300K with shopify payments and no issues, that is the reason I switched. That is also why I needed to make other post ID ads for the different website ( copied the same interests ) See below stats from the moment I switched: ( See before one post before ) It has not been doing good since. ‚Ä¢ product selling price & break even ROAS: Price: $41 // BROAS: 1.42 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product: 5 ‚Ä¢ daily ad set budget: $450 $10 and $20/day adsets and CBOs ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' total ad spend vs. total ROAS: Ad spend: $2,226.19 // ROAS: 1.63 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting: USA // CA // AU // UK ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS): CPM: $13.48 // CPC: $1.00 // ROAS: 1.63 ‚Ä¢ do your abandoned checkouts actually have customer data in them: Yes ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR): All time: ATC: 196 // IC: 143 // PUR: 89 Today: ATC: 26 // IC: 20 // PUR: 12 ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (if any): USA, CA, AU, UK ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight: Ad spend: $348.02 ROAS: 1.27 it's 3,5 hours until end of the day ‚Ä¢ are you running retargeting ads?: Yes ‚Ä¢ are you running abandoned checkout e-mails?: Yes ASC did not do well either with the new ads, so I turned it off after 3 days with barely breaking even.

Do I just give this a little more time? Or is there a way to replace the link on the old ads?

eddie: Hey, Yeah, you lost all optimization. I'm not sure if you can redirect from the old ads without getting banned or some shit. This will likely get better over time though. Test new creatives, too.

eddie: Hey, you shouldn't have started CBOs. The PDF clearly tells you scaling is just for when you're profitable. You're just gonna lose more money otherwise - which is what's happening to you. 1. Your website either sucks or your product just isn't a winner (can't tell which - because I've never seen them). Improve your images + copywriting. 2. No, obviously not. There's no room to scale when you can't be profitable consistently. Fix your website, but also look for new products.

eddie: Hey, man. Your BE roas is unusable. Drop the COGS or the product. Next.

Retard girl hates daddy: Hey, @eddie ‚Ä¢ product selling price & break even ROAS $39.95 - 1.5 ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product 3, today is my 3rd day ‚Ä¢ daily ad set budget Today - $120 (5 T5 with $10, 7 US only $10 a day), yesterday $150 with 0.81 ROAS, 16 October $180 with 1.3 ROAS (some sales Fb missed) ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' total ad spend vs. total revenue $403 - $459 Shopify data/ $359 Facebook data ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting US + T5 ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS) $25 - 1.89 - 0.89 ‚Ä¢ do your abandoned checkouts actually have customer data in them Yes ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR) 30 - 27 - 7 ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (if any) US, then AU with only 1 sale ‚Ä¢ how much did you spend in the last 7 days in total on each country & how much revenue did you make from each (use the breakdown tool) US made spent $280 made $419.54, AU spent $33 made $39.95 ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight $72 - 7 hours no retargeting ads, emails ‚Ä¢ anything else you want me to know or your question Some ad sets got a sale from the first day, but after the first day they haven't got a sale yet. The competitor who mainly runs the same product has 54 active results on Facebook. I know tracking apps are not working well, and recently work way worse because of Shopify updates, but it shows this store made $65,000 in the last 30 days, also Similarweb software shows they have a 10k traffic to their store. I think this product can work as it was profitable on the fist day of testing this. Should I kill this product?(I want to run to be honest, only if you advise me I can to run). And I want to test a few new ad videos today if you advise, as you advised me yesterday to make new (way better) ads if today will not be profitable. Is this possible that I am not targeting the right audience? Thank you Eddie, for analyzing my metrics. (edited)

eddie: Hey, First , always give me real data, not underreported Facebook data. And then, it looks like you're profitable in the USA. Stop telling me what spy tools are saying also, they're not accurate. Not real data. Today you got 0 sales? Cut it then.

Kinky wine-drinking auntie: Hey @eddie this is a continuation of the product I posted last time ( https://discord.com/channels/986590128346660944/1098053979981754369/1152641612200038562 ) I had to cut the previous ads bc of issues with my cash flow and BE, so I got a credit card, lowered cogs and increased the selling price. Last time I sold it for $118.89 which worked nicely. This time I hiked the price up to $164.99 which I thought I could get away with because of product value but it looks like a flop now. Not sure if I need to move on or if I‚Äôd have to spend around double what my product cost is to thoroughly test. Here‚Äôs the results so far : ‚Ä¢ product selling price & break even ROAS : $169.34 / 1.28-1.39 (different prices for different countries, USA is 1.34) ‚Ä¢ for how many days have you run ads for this product: 8 hours ‚Ä¢ daily ad set budget : 8 USA - ¬£20, 8 T4- ¬£10 ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' total ad spend vs. total revenue: $76.63 vs $0 ‚Ä¢ countries you're targeting: USA & T4 ‚Ä¢ last 7 days' metrics (CPM, CPC, ROAS) : $44.19, $1.54, 0 ‚Ä¢ do your abandoned checkouts actually have customer data in them - yes I have 1 ‚Ä¢ overall buying intent (ATC, IC, PUR) 2, 1, 0 ‚Ä¢ what countries are the buying intent or sales coming from (if any): none ‚Ä¢ today's ad spend vs. today's ROAS, and how many hours are left until midnight: $76.63 vs 0, 16 hours ‚Ä¢ are you running retargeting ads? : No ‚Ä¢ are you running abandoned checkout e-mails? : Yes ‚Ä¢ screenshot of the important metrics in the ads manager (optional) ‚Ä¢ anything else you want me to know or your question Cogs are Us - $43.89 Uk - $37.89 Ca - $48.89 Aus - $41.89 (Shipping included) So if I were to bring the price down to $118 again, it doesn‚Äôt leave me with much profit, right? Do you just suggest I move on if I can‚Äôt lower the cogs anymore? Or should I test different prices starting a little low to see where the resistant point is. Thank you boss, bless (edited)

eddie: Hey, You made a bold move... You increased the price a lot. Now if you want a real answer, you wait and spend $150-200 before you cut shit off.

eddie: Hey, Massive CPCs. Q4 competition's ramping up! I'd kill. New ads or next.

I have a plan to make a CBO for the best interest I have right now, 7.62 ROAS so even if it gets no sales tomorrow (day 3, it'd still be over 2.5). Then schedule 3 new ad sets targetting diff interests. I bought another USA profile, will add it to the BM soon What do you say, correct? Thanks a lot (edited)

I turned off ads last night instead of running another day because I didn‚Äôt know if I would struggle scaling a product with a BE ROAS like this or not. 2-3 IC and 2-3 ATC came from the same interest as well. I also am warming up the ad account too. Do you recommend I skip this product, or up the product selling price and try to see how it performs. My competitor is selling it for $30 USD (the same price as me). I also have been charging shipping @eddie (edited)

eddie: What's up, pimp? Looking good! Let's add 4-5 more interests for tomorrow, see what happens. Let me know. And add the new profile as admin, yes.

eddie: Hey, awful BE ROAS, but quite a bit of buying intent. You only spent $50 so far though, I'd give it one more day, kill before it reaches $70-80 in total if you get no sales.

eddie: Hey, CPC is massive, you should have stopped this earlier, man. Annoying because you got decent buying intent, so I see why you let it roll a bit longer. You can't go far with $3 CPC though, try new ads or next.

eddie: I'd run it longer. You spent $145 - which is half of what I'd spend on a 1st day's test. Not sure why you chose to only do a quarter of the strategy. And you got really good buying intent. I'd turn off every ad set without a checkout, and I'd add 3-4 more for the next day. You didn't spend enough to take a decision.

eddie: Hey, you're welcome. 1.57 ROAS combined with a $1.82 CPC - won't get you anywhere, man. Everything's too expensive. If you want to give this product a shot, make new ads, completely new (new content - even if it's ripped), and set up abandoned checkout emails. Those will benefit you later on with other product tests anyway. Then give it a shot like that. If it doesn't bring any profit, move on.

eddie: Hey, what's good! Look at you go, man! Hell yeahhh! Okay, so... You're quite profitable, we'll push more now, we need to get to $1K-2K days, I think we can with the current ads, and then we get new. So, we'll take some risks here in favor of stealing some more market share and gain momentum: 1. Duplicate profitable ad sets up to 5, at $20/day - replace the interests with new ones and similar ones. Schedule for midnight. 2. Schedule just 1 CBO for tomorrow with your best performing ad set in it, as it is. No need to change anything about it, same ads, same targeting, etc. $100/day Tomorrow could go a bit bad, but we need to push and see where the resistance is. Keep me posted!

eddie: Welcome back, Girl with hairy legs. Na, man. This isn't looking good honestly. Your website's definitely not convincing enough, the checkout -> purchase drop is quite high and... Combined with the $1.8, it won't become profitable. I can guarantee it. I'd move on to the next. (edited)

ALSO, at midnight only 3 of 6 ads were active, and the other ones became active at 3AM first... thing 60% of the ads havent spend anything as they got active later idk why they havent spent, while some others have spent like 10usd - its not fair and hard to judge when some creatives dont get their chance no? @eddie (edited)

eddie: Hey, Good start, but crazy CPC, damn. Q4 competition busting the balls of new tests. I'd still keep this going for a few days to see what's up. You didn't write the revenue from each country so... Kill every ad set without a checkout at the end of the day. Make 3-4 new ad sets with new interests tomorrow, targeting the country combination (USA or T4) that brought the sales.

eddie: I said this before: Don't waste time testing shit that failed before. No, it has nothing to do with the ads that didn't get reviewed. You don't listen and you're wasting time & money, up to you.

eddie: Hey, This is not looking as bad as you might think. Let's focus all on USA for tomorrow. So, at midnight, kill all ad sets that have not been profitable within those 3 days, including ones started today and... Make 3-4 new ad sets targeting USA only with new interests, scheduled for tomorrow. Let's see how that goes!

eddie: Hey, hey! Beautiful CPM. I'll ignore it. Not a bad start though. Let's rush this, 5 new ad sets for tomorrow, 3 similar interests, 2 new ones. Kill all ad sets at the end of the day that got no sales. See what happens tomorrow and then we can take a decision.

eddie: Ohhhh shit! Nice. Classic shitty CPM, but we move. Good buying intent. UK sales, a bit random but it's okay, we still keep going with USA included. You sent metrics a little early but... I'd kill all ad sets with 0 checkouts at the end of the day. We'll risk some ad spend tomorrow because you got custom content, so we gotta give it a good shot. And make 4-5 new ad sets at $20/day, duplicates of your current ones with sales - but new + similar interests. Keep me posted.

eddie: Hey, Yeah, too much struggle with this one. CPCs were okay, ironically, I feel like you were maybe getting shit traffic from over-engaging ads. Either way, I'd skip this one.

eddie: Heyyyy, I don't recommend running just the USA half of the strategy nowadays, with Q4 CPMs going up like crazy. However, you did get some buying intent, even got a sale. $84 is not much ad spend for a product that costs $70, so... Although it's risky, for this test so far, I don't think you got an answer yet. I'd kill all ad sets with no checkouts at midnight, and... I'd schedule 3 more USA-only ad sets for tomorrow ($20/day), and 3 Top4 ad sets ($10/day). New intersts. Tomorrow you should get a clearer answer as to whether this has potential or is a bust.

eddie: Hey, Man, this just doesn't seem like a winner. Honestly, I'm thinking that if you were to do a better job with the website & ads, it would probably work, but I can't see them so I can't advise you there. This is too much of a struggle, so if you don't think you can improve what I mentioned above, try a different product because you're burning cash.

eddie: Hey. Not looking too great so far, but you did get 2 sales... So there's buying intent. I, personally would wait until the end of the day, but just know that it's risky to do so. It's more likely that it's not going to work, but if you want a real answer - you have to burn some more cash. Up to you, you can take the safe route and pull out.

Let's do 2 USA-only ad sets for tomorrow, 3 TOP4, all new interests, schedule for midnight. Kill new ad sets (started today) that got no sales today.

One boob longer than the other: @eddie please review Sale price- $40; BEROAS- 1.38 Ran for 53 days Daily ad spend/set $140 (1 cbo with interest- $100, 1 retargeting cbo- $20, 1 abo with 1 interest- $20) Last 7 days ad spend- 932.51 vs last 7 days roas- 1.63 Last 7 days metrics- CPM- $20, CPC- $.92, ROAS- 1.63 Yes, abandoned checkouts have customer data (address, phone #, email) Buying intent- ATC-70, ITC-63, PUR-37 Only targeting USA Todays ad spend- 32.72 vs todays roas- 1.22, 14 hrs until midnight (est) I have 2 cbo‚Äôs running (1 for roughly 45 days, and i launched a retargeting cbo from the spreadsheet). The retargeting cbo has 3 creatives in each adset, 6 total, and the cbo with the winning audience has 1 creative (my winning creative). I‚Äôve been running this product for a month/half n have been running 1 interest in a cbo, and recently launched retargeting campaign on Oct 20th (ran well over the weekend). I doubling the budget of the cbo ($100 to $200) of my winning interest last weekend (oct 14th and 15th) and ran it for 1 ¬Ω days and my roas was a .8. I dropped the budget back down to $100 after This weekend, my daily budget was $100 and performed a lot better (the metrics above) reading over pdf, and you also replied to have a 30% profit margin consistently before scaling but my results r super inconsistent I'll be honest i have no idea how to scale this puppy, and product is untapped as well (edited)

eddie: High CPC but you did get a sale. I'd wait until the end of the day, man. CPCs should go down. Your ad account has nothing to do with the bad results, unless you spam tested on it without letting it deoptimize.

eddie: Hey, An "untapped puppy" doesn't make a winner though. It could just be a low tier winner that can't be scaled. Your CPCs are quite low. Your ads' are probably very engaging but not selling much. I can only assume that's the case. Your website's probably not doing this product justice either. I can't see it, so I can't tell. Are you running 4-7 ads? If you want to give this a real shot, test new creatives already. It's been a month and a half, and polish the copywriting on your store, add better content on there.

The first day of testing was 16 October, and 2 days before it was profitable. I think a person with experience can scale this product well, as this product even not available on Aliexpress that much only 2 or 3 sellers with a few orders, but I could run it successfully as I see. I spent $1050 to this product and lost $400. There are yet some ad sets with 2.5 ROAS after 7 days, but I want to kill it or want to run a CBO with the most profitable ad set for tomorrow. Thank you, Eddie. (edited)

eddie: What's up! Na, today's fine. Chill out. Your performance initially was mad, it will even out to normality eventually. And we'll push it to normality anyway, by scaling. Dude, stop bumping budgets, you got no budget. What're you doing? Add 3-5 new ad sets in the ABO to test new interests and cruise a bit until you get money. Turn off unprofitable ad sets in the last 3 days> And meanwhile, yes, focus on upsells and perfecting the website now. You can add a ton of creative upsells for your product. Add reconvert too.

eddie: Hey, not bad for a first test. Low AOV though. no bueno. Schedule 3 more USA ad sets, new interests, and 2 top 4. Kill everything that didn't get a sale at the end of the day. Let's see how tomorrow goes.

eddie: Hey, Hmmm... mid winner, annoying. I'm thinking that - besides your product being mid - your website is probably not helping. You get a lot of traffic but they don't convert enough. It's tough to say what's wrong without seeing it, but re-evaluate your website and make some improvements there. Imagines. Titles, copywriting. Other than that, add some upsells + reconvert to minmax, and... Test new products. Let this cruise and test new shit. There's one product out there waiting to make you rich. Trust me. Remember this. Go.

eddie: Hey, biggboi. Yeahhhh, there we go! Love it. For tomorrow... Add 5-6 new interests in the ABO campaign, scheduled at midnight. Schedule 2 CBOs for tomorrow, single-ad set, with your duplicated best ad sets. Only kill new ad sets that had no checkouts today. Kill older ad sets that have been unprofitable in the last 4 days (and got no sale today) We're pushing more aggressively now for tomorrow. Tomorrow you need to keep me posted throughout the day so we can scale to $3K or so.

eddie: Hey, turtle shit. Man, I told you... Try different ads because you'll burn money. Same with your website, I don't know what you're selling so it's hard to say but... Improve the pictures, titles. Focus in on the main selling point, etc. If you keep going like this you'll just break even probably. Not worth it. Try new ads using the creative testing PDF. Sure, duplicate your current working ad set and try a similar interest but that's it.

eddie: Hey, Na, this is a bust. $30 selling price and $3.72 CPC. Kill.

eddie: Hey, This isn't looking amazing. UK is the only one getting sales, never a great sign. I'd say try 3-4 interests targeting just UK for tomorrow. If they're not working out, skip.

eddie: Hey, This isn't looking super bad. You might have a decent product here, but I think your ads are the issue. EOD: Kill ad sets with no sales. For tomorrow, schedule 3-4 new interests duplicated from the ad sets that got sales. Let me know how it goes tomorrow, and we'll see what's up.

Disturbingly curved & fat penis: From the last update it started doing better but at low scale, bringing in $300-500 in profits every day.

eddie: Hey, we can't scale with just 1.67 ROAS really. You still spent quite a bit on Canada, why? I was suggesting you remove it. Your ads are very cheap it seems, and USA doesn't convert that well still. Hmm... it must be your product or website (probably both, this product's probably not a big winner). You can keep running this at low level, but if you want it to work better, I'd say improve your website. Do some research on the product and write a better description. Use better, branded pictures. Do a competitor comparison chart. Offer a free gift.

eddie: Hey, From what I see in your metrics, you're most likely selling a mid-winner / non-winner. I'd say work on your website (images/videos/copywriting). Add upsells. Start abandoned checkout e-mails + retargeting ads.

eddie: Hey, man. It's not looking too bad, but what's worrying is that USA got no sales. Kill everything with no checkouts. Schedule 4 more ad sets with new interests for tomorrow: 2x USA-only 2x Top5 See what you get then.

eddie: Yeah, kill it. And start listening to my advice. You're selling a $25 product, which is dumb in itself but... Also tells me you probably have bad ads because you can't listen to simple advice.

eddie: Ahh, bad CPC for the new ads. Probably not better than the old ones. Honestly, this product looks like a struggle.

eddie: Hey, man. Ads aren't looking too bad but no buying intent. I'd think it's your website, or this product's not a winner, or a mid-winner. It's a bit of a tough time right now at the end of October, too. Mid-winners are hard to make work without amazing ads and website.

eddie: Hey, Not an awful start. Let's give it more time until the end of the day. If you keep getting orders from USA, then make a few new USA ad sets for tomorrow and get rid of all the ones that didn't get sales.

My shopify didn't track 1 sale as well, but I've been profitable today. I got 2 sales today, and also got 2 yesterday. How do I go on from here, what do you recommend Top E? Is it too early to jump in the CBO game, or how would you see it? (edited)

eddie: Guys, stop writing what FB tracked. Who cares? It's irrelevant. Give me real metrics. Anyway, it's looking good so far. Kill ad sets that got no sales at all within the last 2 days, and new ad sets with no checkouts today. Make 3-4 new ad sets at $20/day, USA-only, new interests. Keep me posted.

eddie: Nice, UK's working out. Let's kill new ad sets with no sales today EOD. And kill old ad sets that haven't been profitable within the last 3 days. And let's add 4-5 more UK-only ad sets, new interests.

Should I run these interests for US tomorrow to see how they do? Also US seems to have very high CPMs, with one interest having a $83 CPM and a $6 CPC. (edited)

eddie: Not looking great so far. CPC also kinda' high for the amount of buying intent you got. But... You did get a sale, so I'd wait until $100 or so in ad spend to see what happens.

eddie: Hey, Love seeing people struggle with $25 products. Okay, so... I'd kill all ad sets that aren't profitable within the last 3 days. Add 3-4 new ad sets duplicated from the ones that are profitable. Change interests. Schedule at midnight. Add upsells, very necessary at that shitty price. And add reconvert - #üîßÔ∏±quick-links Keep looking for other products, too.

eddie: Hey, it's not looking great... I'd give it 1 more day. Kill all ad sets without sales or at least 2 checkouts. Add 3 new ones, duplicated from the ad sets that got sales. If tomorrow it's not at least break even, kill.

eddie: Hey, Not a bad first day. Okay, hmm... Very little spend went to T4. I'd kill all ad sets that got less than 2 checkouts today. And I'd make 4 more ad sets with similar interests to the ones that worked well so far, USA-only. And 1 T4 ad set, I want to give it another shot. We'll re-evaluate tomorrow. (edited)

eddie: Hey, CPM & CPC are a little high. You got 1 sale, but no real abandoned checkouts. If you want a real answer, wait for $100 or so in ad spend. But understand that it's a risk, and the current metrics indicate there's not a good chance that this product will work. We'll not know clearly though until you spend around $100, so take a decision you're comfortable with, in terms of risk.

eddie: Hey, EOD: kill all ad sets with no checkouts or sales Schedule for midnight: 3 UK-only ad sets at $20/day, new interests 3 USA-only ad sets at $20/day, new interests + the current working ones

eddie: Hey, First of all, there's nothing to scale here, we still have to validate the product. Secondly, either your store's not too convincing or your ads are not properly selling the benefits of the product. I'd kill all ad sets without any checkouts.

eddie: Hey, Hmm... Slightly profitable today. 7 days, overall profitable, nothing too good though. I'd continue with UK, same strat again. Kill new ad sets with no sales today EOD. And kill old ad sets that haven't been profitable within the last 3 days. And add 4-5 more UK-only ad sets, new interests Start e-mails for abandoned checkouts to make a bit more cash.

eddie: Hey, ... Why test "untapped products" with shitty internet content? I test untapped products with my own content so I can make it work the right way straight away. If you want to keep going with this, you need way better ads. People aren't clicking on them enough. That, or kill it.

It the second product I am testing this week, and both worked well on the first day with %20 profit and I think it is a good winner, but after the first day it turns to be unprofitable. My second question, some ad sets was profitable on the first day, that was why I let them run more days, but now they are going to be unprofitable as there are no sales yesterday, and today. ROAS are 3.4 , 1.76, 1.75, 1.7. Should I kill them today too as there is no sale yesterday and today? And should I kill all the ad sets and run only new creatives? (edited)

My CPC is mainly being brought up by 3-4 ad groups with $3.50-$4.00 CPC, without those would probably be around a $1.2 CPC overall. Also have 145 online sessions and a 6.21% CVR. One quick question for future tests is what spend do you let ad groups go until you kill if you see they have high CPC's? I know in PDF it says after $30 spend but just wanted your take if it matters how much ad group spends after that. Looking to see next steps; looking at PDF's also. Thank you again you are the best for this discord! (edited)

eddie: Hey, Na, fat bust. Kill it.

eddie: Hey, Not bad, but USA didn't do great. Let's kill all ad sets without a checkout. And duplicate 5 of the best ad sets you got (make sure at least 3 of them are targeting T5), change interests to similar ones, and schedule for midnight. (edited)

The last 7 days tracked from the 25th October - 1st November (today included). I also lowered the price thinking it was going to do anything from $38 as yesterday had 0 sales with $50 budget (edited)

eddie: Hey, Stop writing sales information from Facebook. Anyway, it looks decent. Shit day today but it's fine. Lowering the price is never an option, it's just accepting defeat. Kill new ad sets that brought no sales today within $20. Kill old unprofitable ad sets within the last 3 days. Schedule 4 new Top4 ad sets at $20/day for midnight.
