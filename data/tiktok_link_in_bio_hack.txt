TIKTOK LINK IN BIO - EDDIE'S INSTANT HACK

REQUIREMENTS: 0 followers needed!

STEP 1: SWITCH TO BUSINESS ACCOUNT
- Top right menu → Settings & Privacy → Manage Account → Switch to Business Account

STEP 2: REGISTER FAKE BUSINESS (Eddie's Method)
- Go to Business Suite → Business Registration
- Use this fake data that works:

Business Name: MVP Workarounds LLC
Country: United States  
Address: 16192 Coastal Highway
State: Delaware
City: Sussex County
Zip: 19958
Phone: Your real number (need to receive verification code)
Business License ID: 23-1024770 (or make up format: xx-xxxxxxx)

STEP 3: UPLOAD CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION
- Modify the fake certificate provided in original PDF
- Change business name to your store name or selling point
- TikTok shows business name under profile, so use it strategically
- Don't all use exact same info - TikTok catches repeated submissions

STEP 4: VERIFY & WAIT
- Verify phone number with code
- Submit registration
- Check back in few hours (max 1 day)
- You'll get approval notification

STEP 5: ADD LINK
- Edit profile and add link in bio
- Works immediately after approval

EDDIE'S WARNING:
This worked when I wrote it. TikTok might catch on eventually. Use different info variations.

STRATEGIC TIP:
Pick business name that represents product benefit - TikTok displays it under your profile name, so turn this "handicap" into a selling point!
