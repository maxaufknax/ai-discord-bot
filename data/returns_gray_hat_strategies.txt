RETURNS - EDDIE'S GRAY HAT METHODS

WARNING: Only use for dropshipping stores, NEVER for long-term brands. Customers won't be entirely happy.

GENERAL RULES:
- Always ask "why" when customer requests refund
- Never just refund without trying to save it
- Train VAs with these exact methods
- 2-week return policy instead of 30-60 days

THE WAREHOUSE TRICK:
- If customer in USA → say return warehouse is in Europe
- If customer in Europe → say return warehouse is in USA
- High shipping costs make alternatives more appealing

SOLUTIONS TO OFFER:
1. PARTIAL REFUND: Start with 20-30% based on customer anger level
2. REPLACEMENT: Free replacement for size/color issues (customer pays shipping)
3. ALTERNATIVE ITEM: Have higher-priced backup product as "free" replacement

MAGIC EMAIL TEMPLATE:
"Hey, CustomerName.
Thank you for contacting us, we'll be more than happy to help!

Oh, no! I'm so sorry to hear that.

We can assist you with a return, however, it would have to come to our <European country> address (most of our customers come from the EU, that's why we have it there).

Please note that shipping costs may be high due to the weight of the package & distance, and they're the responsibility of the customer; but I spoke to my manager earlier and we came up with a few options that might be more beneficial for you.

We, as a company, will be at a loss on this order either way, so here's what we could do to make things easier for you:
We're happy to let you keep the item (maybe it comes in handy one day, maybe it can be gifted), in order to help you avoid paying the hefty shipping fees, and we'll still instantly refund you 20% of what you paid. That may end up being a little more than what you'd be left with if you were to pay a return fee, so I really think this would be a lot cheaper. We'll take the loss, no problem. Your happiness = our goal."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION:
a) Customer keeps original order
b) Gets "more expensive" replacement for free  
c) Avoids return shipping costs

EDDIE'S HARSH REALITY: 
We don't actually want the product back. This is about saving money through creative manipulation while staying technically honest.
